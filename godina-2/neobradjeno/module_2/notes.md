~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MATTER~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In chemical elements, you write the element and then to the left of it on the lower side you write the number of protons (Z) and on the upper side you write neutrons (N).

Matter is what all things are made of; whatever occupies space, has mass, and is perceptible to the senses in some way.
It cannot be created or destroyed.
All matter is made up of atoms

Atoms are the smallest particles of matter that establishes the unique characteristics of a substance.

All atoms are basically, the same size and consist of two main parts:
The outer part is composed of 1 or more orbits of electrons;
The other part, located at the centre, the nucleus.

The nucleus is composed of two kinds of particles of roughly equal size and substance packed closely together.
They're called the proton and neutron.
The simplest atom is hydrogen which has has one proton, one neutron and one electron.
The size of an atom is determined by its electron orbits, its substance is determined by the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus.


Atoms were made up of three fundamental sub-atomic particles.

Those are: 
Neutron of relative mass 1 and electrical charge of zero, it is located in the nucleus; 
Proton of relative mass 1 and electrical charge of positive, it is located in the nucleus;
Electron of relative mass 1/1850 and electrical charge of negative, it is arranged in energy levels or shells around the nucleus.

The elements in the periodic table are laid out in order of Atomic Number.
Hydrogen 1, H, does not readily fit into any Group.
A Group is a vertical column of like elements, the Group number equals the number of electrons in the outer shell.
A Period is a horizontal row of elements with a variety of properties. The Period number equals the number of shells.
The closest shell to the nucleus can only contain two orbiting electrons. 
The second shell can only hold eight electrons.
The third shell is filled with up to eight electrons.
When the fourth shell contains eight electrons, the number of electrons in the third shell begins to increase again until a maximum of 18 is reached. 
The 1st shell can hold 2, the 2nd 8, the 3rd 18, the 4th 32 and the 5th 50 electrons.
The outer-most orbital shell of any atom’s electrons is called the valence shell. 
The number of electrons in the valence shell determines the chemical bonding properties of the material as well as other characteristics such as conductivity.
When the valence shell has the maximum number of electrons, it is complete and the electrons tend to be bound strongly to the nucleus. 
Materials with this characteristic are chemically stable. 
It takes a large amount of force to move the electrons in this situation from one atom valence shell to that of another. 
Since the movement of electrons is called electric current, substances with complete valence shells are known as good insulators because they resist the flow of electrons (electricity). 

Elements are pure substances, made up of atoms with the same number of protons.

An element: 
Consists of only one kind of atom, 
Cannot be broken down into a simpler type of matter by either physical or chemical means, and 
can exist as either atoms or molecules.

Mixtures are of pure substances, have the properties of the different substances that make it up, melt at a range of temperatures and are easy to separate.
Mixtures are atoms and molecules that are physically mixed together but are not chemically bonded.
Mixtures can usually be separated by filtering, evaporation or some other mechanical means.

A mixture:
consists of two or more different elements and/or compounds physically intermingled,
can be separated into its components by physical means, and
often retains many of the properties of its components.

Compounds are pure substances made up more than 1 element which have been joined together by a chemical reaction, therefore the atoms are difficult to separate.
Compounds are materials made up of two or more elements that have chemically bonded.
Compounds can only be seperated by chemical reaction.
Chemical analysis is the splitting of a compound.

A compound:
consists of atoms of two or more different elements bound together,
can be broken down into a simpler type of matter (elements) by chemical means (but not by physical means),
has properties that are different from its component elements, and
always contains the same ratio of its component atoms.

The atomic number or the proton number is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom.
It is represented by the symbol Z.
In an atom of neutral charge, atomic number is equal to the number of electrons.

The mass number (A), or atomic mass number or nucleon number, is the number of protons and neutrons (nucleons) in an atomic nucleus.

The number of neutrons (N) is the difference between the mass number and the atomic number. N=A-Z

Molecules are a pure substance which results when two or more atoms of a single element share electrons, or 
they're a compound, which is a combination of two or more atoms of two or more different elements.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. 
This gives each isotope of the element a different mass or nucleon number ,but 
being the same element they have the same atomic or proton number.
the heavier isotope has a greater density and boiling point. 
However, because they have the same number of protons they have the same electronic structure and are identical chemically.
the three isotopes of hydrogen are called hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium.

Free electrons are electrons that are in incomplete valence shells and as a consequence, they can move freely from valence shell to valence shell of different atoms or compounds.
Electric current or current flow is the movement of electrons.
A conductor is a substance within which electrons can move freely from atom to atom or compound to compound.

~~~~~STATES OF MATTER~~~~~

4 common states of matter are solid, liquid, gas and plasma.
The compound(s) from which a substance is made do not change, regardless of the state of matter.
Atoms and molecules that make up a substance are always in motion due to heat energy in the material.
The state of matter is related to the motion between them.
Solid state has the least motion while gas and plasma have the most.

Plasma is made of ionized gas which itself is made of positive ions and free electrons, resulting in a relatively neutral electric charge.
It's particles are close enough together that they act collectively when exposed to a magnetic field.
It's also very electrically conductive.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MECHANICS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~STATICS~~~~~

Force is the influence tending to change the motion of a body or produce stress in a stationary body.
Stress is the effect of force acting on a stationary body or structure.
Force is measured in pounds or newtons.
When force is applied at a distance from the point at which the effects of the force are being considered, 
the force measurement includes a distance component such as pound-inches or newton-meters.
Force has magnitude and direction so it's represented by a vector.

The central point of an aircraft in aerodynamics is the center of lift, while in weight and balance it's the center of gravity.

The resultant is the consolidation of multiple vectors into a single vector.
Forces are coupled when two equal forces of opposite direction are applied to a body parallel to each other, as a consequence they produce a rotating force upon the body.
The resultant movement caused by the coupled force is known as torque.
Moment is the difference between an applied force and the reference point,
but a moment torque of coupled forces doesn't have a reference point, so it's a free vector.

~~~CENTER OF GRAVITY (CG)~~~

The center of gravity of an aircraft is the balance point of it.
The center of gravity is the point about which the weight of an airplane is concentrated.

An arm is a horizontal distance that a part is located from a reference point called the datum.
The datum is specified by the manufacturer.
The moment is the product of a weight (force) multiplied by its arm.
The moment for a piece of equipment installed on an aircraft is a torque value, measured in inch-pounds (in-lb) or newton-meters. 
Maintenance personnel are required to incorporate center of gravity considerations during routine inspections as well as when the aircraft is modified with new equipment.
Flight personnel must also insure the CG remains within safe limits when loading passengers, baggage and fuel.

~~~ELEMENTS OF THEORY OF STRESS~~~

Stress is the internal resistance to deformation.
The 5 major stresses to which all aircraft are subjected are: Tension, compression, torsion, shear and bending.

Tension is the stress that resists a force that tends to pull something apart (stretch).
The tensile strength of a material is measured in pounds per square inch (psi), 
and is calculated by dividing the load (in pounds) required to pull the material apart by its cross-sectional area (in square inches).

Compression is the stress that resists a crushing force.
The compressive strength of a material is measured in psi.

Torsion is the stress that resists twisting.
The torsion strength of a material is its resistance to twisting or torque.

Shear is the stress that resists the force tending to cause one layer of a material to slide over an adjacent layer.

Bending stress is a combination of compression and tension, 
because when something is bent it is compressed on the inside of the bend and stretched on the outside.

~~~STRAIN~~~

When an object becomes distorted by an applied force, the object is said to be strained, whether in plastic or elastic deformation.
A deflecting beam torque wrench uses the strain on the drive end of the wrench, 
and the resulting distortion of the beam to indicate the amount of torque on a bolt or nut.

~~~~~NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER~~~~~

~~~SOLID~~~

Matter is said to be solid when it has a definite volume and shape. 
They are incompressible and do not contain enough movement of the molecules to permit a physical change of shape.

~~~LIQUID~~~

Liquid matter is characterized by molecules that have more energy and increased movement. 
This causes the molecules to be able flow and not take a rigid shape such as a solid. 
Liquids take the shape of their container even though the volume of a liquid does not change significantly. 
Liquids are said to be incompressible.
The molecules are also closely bound enough to each other that surface tension is created.

~~~GAS~~~

Gases take the shape of their container but unlike liquids, gases are compressible. 
When pressure is applied, the molecules can be made to exist closer to each other.
It is possible to put a gas under so much pressure that is changes to a liquid state.

~~~CHANGES BETWEEN STATES~~~

Matter can change between the states by adding or removing energy.
For example when heat energy is added to water, 
water vapor is formed as the motion of the molecules causes more freedom of movement between molecules.
The heat energy added or subtracted to a substance is typically measured by temperature. 
The higher the temperature of a substance, the more energy it contains. 
Heat always flows from hot to cold. 
These terms express the relative amount of energy present in two substances, they do not measure the absolute amount of heat present.
Without a difference in energy levels, there is no transfer of energy (heat).
Adding heat to a substance does not always raise its temperature. 
When a substance changes state, such as when a liquid changes into a vapor, heat energy is absorbed. 
This is called latent heat. 
When a vapor condenses into a liquid, this heat energy is given off.
The temperature of a substance remains constant during its change of state. 
All energy absorbed or given off, the latent heat, is used for the change process. 
Once the change of state is complete, heat added to a substance raises the temperature of the substance. 
After a substance changes state into a vapor, the rise in temperature of the vapor caused by the addition of still more heat is called superheat.
The temperature at which a substance changes from a liquid into a vapor when heat is added is known as its boiling point. 
This is the same temperature at which a vapor condenses into a liquid when heat is removed.
When pressure on a liquid is increased, its boiling point increases, and when pressure on a liquid is decreased, its boiling point also decreases.
Water boils at 212 °F at normal atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psi.
At 20 psi it boils at 226.4 °F.
At 10 psi it boils at 194 °F.
Vapor pressure is the pressure of the vapor that exists above a liquid that is in an enclosed container at any given temperature. 
A substance that is said to be volatile, develops high vapor pressure at standard day temperature (59 °F).

~~~PRESSURE AND BUOYANCY~~~

~~BUOYANCY~~

The weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³
The weight density of air is 0.07651 lb/ft³
Buoyant force is an upward force that any fluid exerts on a body submerged in it.
Archimedes’ principle is that the buoyant force which a fluid exerts upon a submerged body is equal to the weight of the fluid the body displaces.
Buoyant force = volume of object × density of fluid displaced
A 10-ft³ object weighing 700 lbs is placed in pure water. Will the object float?
Buoyant force = 10 × 62.4 = 624lbs which is less than 700, so the object will sink.

~~FLUID PRESSURE~~

The pressure exerted on the bottom of a container by a liquid is determined by the height of the liquid and not by the shape of the container.
One gallon of water weighs 8.34 lb.
Pressure based on the column height of a fluid is known as static pressure.
With liquids, such as gasoline, it is sometimes referred to as a head of pressure.
For example, if a carburetor needs to have 2 psi supplied to its inlet (head of pressure), 
this could be accomplished by having the fuel tank positioned the appropriate number of inches higher than the carburetor.
When a fluid is in motion, and its velocity is converted to pressure, that pressure is known as ram. 
When ram pressure and static pressure are added together, the result is known as total pressure.
In the inlet of a gas turbine engine, for example, 
total pressure is often measured to provide a signal to the fuel metering device or to provide a signal to a gauge on the flight deck.
On a standard day at sea level, if a 1 square inch column of air extending to the top of the atmosphere is weighed, it would weigh 14.7 lb. 
That is why standard day atmospheric pressure is said to be 14.7 pounds per square inch (14.7 psi).
Atmospheric pressure is often measured by a mercury barometer. 
A glass tube somewhat over 30 inches in length is sealed at one end and then filled with mercury. 
It is then inverted and the open end placed in a dish of mercury. 
Immediately, the mercury level in the inverted tube will drop a short distance, 
leaving a small volume of mercury vapor at nearly zero absolute pressure in the tube just above the top of the liquid mercury column. 
Gravity acting on the mercury in the tube will try to make the mercury run out. 
Atmospheric pressure pushing down on the mercury in the open container tries to make the mercury stay in the tube. 
At some point these two forces (gravity and atmospheric pressure) will equalize and the mercury will stabilize at a certain height in the tube. 
Under standard day atmospheric conditions, the air in a 1 square inch column extending to the top of the atmosphere weighs 14.7 lb. 
A 1 square inch column of mercury, 29.92 inches tall, also weighs 14.7 lb. 
That is why 14.7 psi is equal to 29.92 "Hg when referring to a barometric reading.
A second means of measuring atmospheric pressure is with an aneroid barometer. 
This mechanical instrument is a much better choice than a mercury barometer for use on airplanes. 
Aneroid barometers (altimeters) are used to indicate altitude in flight.
The pressure of the atmosphere is exerted against an thin metal aneroid connected to the pointer.
Calibrations are made in thousands of feet rather than in psi or inches of mercury. 
For example, the standard pressure at sea level is 29.92 "Hg, or 14.7 psi. 
At 10,000 feet above sea level, standard pressure is 20.58 "Hg, or 10.10 psi. 
Altimeters are calibrated so that if the pressure exerted by the atmosphere is 10.10 psi, the altimeter will point to 10,000 ft.

//////////END OF FIRST DECK//////////

~~~~~KINETICS~~~~~

Kinetics is the study of the relationship between the motion of bodies or objects and the forces acting on them.
Kinematics is the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and distance.
Motion may be defined as a continuing change of position or place, or as the process in which a body undergoes displacement.
When an object is at different points in space at different times, that object is said to be in motion, 
and if the distance the object moves remains the same for a given period of time, the motion may be described as uniform. 
Thus, an object in uniform motion always has a constant speed.
Velocity can be defined as the rate of motion in a particular direction.
Two velocity vectors can be added together in what is called vector analysis.
To convert mph to fps, multiply by 1.467. 
Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. 
The acceleration due to gravity is 32.2 fps/s.
formula for acceleration is: a=(v-v0)/t
To calculate G forces, divide the acceleration by the acceleration due to gravity which is 32.2 fps/s.

~~~NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION~~~

Newton's first law of motion is:
Objects at rest tend to remain at rest and objects in motion tend to remain in motion at the same speed and in the same direction, 
unless acted on by an external force.
Inertia, the property of matter is described in Newton's first law of motion.

Newton's second law of motion is: 
When a force acts upon a body, the momentum of that body is changed; 
The rate of change of momentum is proportional to the applied force.

Bodies in motion have the property called momentum. 
A body that has great momentum has a strong tendency to remain in motion.
Based on Newton’s second law, the formula for calculating thrust is derived, which states that force equals mass times acceleration (F = MA). 
Earlier in this chapter, it was determined that mass equals weight divided by gravity, 
and acceleration equals velocity final minus velocity initial divided by time.
Putting all these concepts together, the formula for thrust is: F=(Q⨯(v-v0))/(g⨯t).
If time isn't mentioned, assume t=1.

Newton’s third law of motion is:
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Newton’s third law of motion is often called the law of action and reaction. 

This means that if a force is applied to an object, 
the object will supply a resistive force exactly equal to and in the opposite direction of the force applied.
Forces always occur in pairs. 
The term acting force means the force one body exerts on a second body, and reacting force means the force the second body exerts on the first.
A turbofan engine exerts a force on the air entering the inlet duct, causing it to accelerate out the fan duct and the tailpipe. 
The air accelerating to the rear is the action, and the force inside the engine that makes it happen is the reaction, also called thrust.

~~~CIRCULAR MOTION~~~

Circular motion is the motion of an object along a curved path that has a constant radius.
For example, if one end of a string is tied to an object and the other end is held in the hand, the object can be swung in a circle. 
The object is constantly deflected from a straight (linear) path by the pull exerted on the string.
The string exerts a centripetal force on the object, and the object exerts an equal but opposite force on the string, obeying Newton’s third law of motion.
The force that is equal to centripetal force, but acting in an opposite direction, is called centrifugal force.
Centripetal force is always directly proportional to the mass of the object in circular motion.
Thus, if the mass of the object is doubled, the pull on the string must be doubled to keep the object in its circular path, provided the speed of the object remains constant.
Centripetal force is inversely proportional to the radius of the circle in which an object travels.
If the string is shortened and the speed remains constant, the pull on the string must be increased since the radius is decreased, 
and the string must pull the object from its linear path more rapidly. 
Using the same reasoning, the pull on the string must be increased if the object is swung more rapidly in its orbit. 
Centripetal force is thus directly proportional to the square of the velocity of the object.
The formula for centripetal force is: F=(m⨯v²)÷r
For the formula above, mass would typically be converted to weight divided by gravity, velocity would be in feet per second, and the radius would be in feet.

~~~PERIODIC MOTION~~~

str. 33

~~PENDULAR~~

Periodic motion is evident during pendular motion and vibration.
A pendulum is a weight suspended from a fixed point so it can swing freely back and forth.
The motion is characterized by a few important variables. 
The period is the time it takes for the weight to complete one cycle of motion. 
It is dependent on the length of the suspending rod or string. 
Specifically, the period varies directly with the square root of "L" which is the length of the suspending item (i.e. a string or rod). 
The period also varies inversely with the square root of the acceleration of gravity.
The following equation expresses these relationships: T=2⨯π⨯(sqrt(L/g)).
Where: T = period in seconds (s); L = length of the pendulum in feet or meters; g = acceleration of gravity (32.2 ft/s² or 9.82 m/s²).
Pendulums are unique in that the period of a pendulum will remain the same as it swings to and fro even though it gradually displaces less and less with each ensuing swing. 
This regularity has resulted in pendulum motion to be the regulating motion in mechanical clocks.

~~VIBRATION~~

Vibration is periodic motion caused by oscillation of the parts of a fluid or an elastic solid whose equilibrium has been disturbed.
An electromagnetic wave also experiences vibration.
Design engineers must design the aircraft to withstand or safely dissipate any vibration produced by 
the engine, components, or by the aircraft's movement through the atmosphere.
Vibratory motion is also known as harmonic motion.
Vibration is characterized by having a period, which is the time it takes for a complete cycle of movement. 
It's frequency is the number of times per second a complete cycle occurs. 
The unit of measure for frequency is the hertz (Hz). 
One cycle per second is equal to one hertz. 
Vibration also has amplitude. 
Amplitude is measured from the midpoint of the motion to the point of maximum displacement. 
Unless there is a means to input energy into the vibrating object, the amplitude of vibration will steadily decrease as time goes on. 
However, the frequency of vibration will remain the same. 
On a musical instrument, it is the frequency that sets the pitch of the tone created when the string is plucked. 
The amplitude is related to the loudness of the vibrating string.
The formula for computing the period of a vibrating or oscillating object is virtually the same as that of a pendulum. 
Instead of gravity supplying the force as with a pendulum, some other force must be applied to create vibration. 
But the uniqueness of a steady frequency is shared by vibrating objects and a pendulum. 
Note that an oscillator in electronics does have a means for steadily supplying extra energy to the vibrating system and does not conform to this model.
T=2⨯π⨯(sqrt(m/k)).
Where: T = period in seconds (s); m = mass in pounds or kilograms (kg); k = force in pound feet or dynes / cm.

~~RESONANCE~~

All types of matter, regardless of whether it is a solid, liquid, or gas, have a natural frequency at which the atoms within that matter vibrate. 
If two pieces of matter have the same natural frequency, and one of them starts to vibrate, it can transfer its wave energy to the other one and cause it to vibrate.
This transfer of energy is known as resonance. 
Some piston engine powered airplanes have an rpm range that they are placarded to avoid because spinning the prop at that rpm can cause vibration problems.
The difficulty lies in the natural frequency of the metal in the prop, and the frequency of vibration that will be set up with a particular tip speed for the prop. 
At that particular rpm, stresses can be set up that could lead to the propeller coming apart.

~~SIMPLE MACHINES~~

A machine is any device with which work may be accomplished. 
In application, machines can be used for any of the following purposes, or combinations of these purposes.

1. Machines are used to transform energy, as in the case of a generator transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy.

2. Machines are used to transfer energy from one place to another, 
as in the examples of the connecting rods, crankshaft, and reduction gears transferring energy from an aircraft’s engine to its propeller.

3. Machines are used to multiply force; for example, a system of pulleys may be used to lift a heavy load. 
The pulley system enables the load to be raised by exerting a force that is smaller than the weight of the load.

4. Machines can be used to multiply speed. A good example is the bicycle, by which speed can be gained by exerting a greater force.

5. Machines can be used to change the direction of a force. An example of this use is the flag hoist. 
A downward force on one side of the rope exerts an upward force on the other side, raising the flag toward the top of the pole.

There are only six simple machines. 
They are the lever, the pulley, the wheel and axle, the inclined plane, the screw, and the gear. Physicists, however, recognize only two basic principles in machines: 
the lever and the inclined plane. 
The pulley (block and tackle), the wheel and axle, and gears operate on the machine principle of the lever. 
The wedge and the screw use the principle of the inclined plane.

Compound machines are combinations of two or more simple machines.

~~MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE OF MACHINES~~

Machines cannot multiply force and speed at the same time.
In order to gain one, it must lose the other. 
To do otherwise would mean the machine has more power going out than coming in, and that is not possible.
In reference to machines, mechanical advantage is a comparison of the output force to the input force, or the output distance to the input distance. 
If there is a mechanical advantage in terms of force, there will be a fractional disadvantage in terms of distance.
The following formulas can be used to calculate mechanical advantage.
Mechanical Advantage = Force Out ÷ Force In
Mechanical Advantage = Distance Out ÷ Distance In

~THE LEVER~

The simplest machine, and perhaps the most familiar one, is the lever. 
A seesaw is a example of a lever.
When a person sits on one end of a seesaw, that person applies a downward force in pounds which acts along the distance to the center of the seesaw. 
This combination of force and distance creates torque, which tries to cause rotation.

FIRST CLASS LEVER

In the first class lever, the fulcrum is located between the effort and the resistance. 
As mentioned earlier, the seesaw is a good example of a lever, and it happens to be a first class lever. 
The amount of weight and the distance from the fulcrum can be varied to suit the need. 
Increasing the distance from the applied effort to the fulcrum, compared to the distance from the fulcrum to the weight being moved, increases the advantage provided by the lever. 
Crowbars, shears, and pliers are common examples of this class of lever. 
The proper balance of an airplane is also a good example, with the center of lift on the wing being the pivot point (fulcrum) 
and the weight fore and aft of this point being the effort and the resistance.
When calculating how much effort is required to lift a specific weight, or how much weight can be lifted by a specific effort, the following formula can be used.
Effort (E) × Effort Arm (L) = Resistance (R) × Resistance Arm (l)
What this formula really shows is the input torque (effort times effort arm) equals the output torque (resistance times resistance arm). 
This formula and concept apply to all three classes of levers, and to all simple machines in general.
An interesting thing to note with this example lever is if the applied effort moved down 10 inches, the weight on the other end would only move up 2 inches. 
The weight being lifted would only move one-fifth as far. 
The reason for this is the concept of work. 
Because a lever cannot have more work output than input, if it allows you to lift 5 times more weight, you will only move it 1/5 as far as you move the effort.

SECOND CLASS LEVER

The second class lever has the fulcrum at one end and the effort is applied at the other end. 
The resistance is somewhere between these points. 
A wheelbarrow is a good example of a second class lever, 
with the wheel at one end being the fulcrum, 
the handles at the opposite end being the applied effort, 
and the bucket in the middle being where the weight or resistance is placed.
Depending on how close or how far away the weight is placed from the fulcrum, the first class lever can be made to gain force or gain distance, but not both at the same time. 
The second class lever can only be made to gain force.

THIRD CLASS LEVER
