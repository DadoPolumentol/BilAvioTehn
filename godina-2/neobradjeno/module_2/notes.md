~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MATTER~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In chemical elements, you write the element and then to the left of it on the lower side you write the number of protons (Z) and on the upper side you write neutrons (N).

Matter is what all things are made of; whatever occupies space, has mass, and is perceptible to the senses in some way.
It cannot be created or destroyed.
All matter is made up of atoms

Atoms are the smallest particles of matter that establishes the unique characteristics of a substance.

All atoms are basically, the same size and consist of two main parts:
The outer part is composed of 1 or more orbits of electrons;
The other part, located at the centre, the nucleus.

The nucleus is composed of two kinds of particles of roughly equal size and substance packed closely together.
They're called the proton and neutron.
The simplest atom is hydrogen which has has one proton, one neutron and one electron.
The size of an atom is determined by its electron orbits, its substance is determined by the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus.


Atoms were made up of three fundamental sub-atomic particles.

Those are: 
Neutron of relative mass 1 and electrical charge of zero, it is located in the nucleus; 
Proton of relative mass 1 and electrical charge of positive, it is located in the nucleus;
Electron of relative mass 1/1850 and electrical charge of negative, it is arranged in energy levels or shells around the nucleus.

The elements in the periodic table are laid out in order of Atomic Number.
Hydrogen 1, H, does not readily fit into any Group.
A Group is a vertical column of like elements, the Group number equals the number of electrons in the outer shell.
A Period is a horizontal row of elements with a variety of properties. The Period number equals the number of shells.
The closest shell to the nucleus can only contain two orbiting electrons. 
The second shell can only hold eight electrons.
The third shell is filled with up to eight electrons.
When the fourth shell contains eight electrons, the number of electrons in the third shell begins to increase again until a maximum of 18 is reached. 
The 1st shell can hold 2, the 2nd 8, the 3rd 18, the 4th 32 and the 5th 50 electrons.
The outer-most orbital shell of any atom’s electrons is called the valence shell. 
The number of electrons in the valence shell determines the chemical bonding properties of the material as well as other characteristics such as conductivity.
When the valence shell has the maximum number of electrons, it is complete and the electrons tend to be bound strongly to the nucleus. 
Materials with this characteristic are chemically stable. 
It takes a large amount of force to move the electrons in this situation from one atom valence shell to that of another. 
Since the movement of electrons is called electric current, substances with complete valence shells are known as good insulators because they resist the flow of electrons (electricity). 

Elements are pure substances, made up of atoms with the same number of protons.

An element: 
Consists of only one kind of atom, 
Cannot be broken down into a simpler type of matter by either physical or chemical means, and 
can exist as either atoms or molecules.

Mixtures are of pure substances, have the properties of the different substances that make it up, melt at a range of temperatures and are easy to separate.
Mixtures are atoms and molecules that are physically mixed together but are not chemically bonded.
Mixtures can usually be separated by filtering, evaporation or some other mechanical means.

A mixture:
consists of two or more different elements and/or compounds physically intermingled,
can be separated into its components by physical means, and
often retains many of the properties of its components.

Compounds are pure substances made up more than 1 element which have been joined together by a chemical reaction, therefore the atoms are difficult to separate.
Compounds are materials made up of two or more elements that have chemically bonded.
Compounds can only be seperated by chemical reaction.
Chemical analysis is the splitting of a compound.

A compound:
consists of atoms of two or more different elements bound together,
can be broken down into a simpler type of matter (elements) by chemical means (but not by physical means),
has properties that are different from its component elements, and
always contains the same ratio of its component atoms.

The atomic number or the proton number is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom.
It is represented by the symbol Z.
In an atom of neutral charge, atomic number is equal to the number of electrons.

The mass number (A), or atomic mass number or nucleon number, is the number of protons and neutrons (nucleons) in an atomic nucleus.

The number of neutrons (N) is the difference between the mass number and the atomic number. N=A-Z

Molecules are a pure substance which results when two or more atoms of a single element share electrons, or 
they're a compound, which is a combination of two or more atoms of two or more different elements.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. 
This gives each isotope of the element a different mass or nucleon number ,but 
being the same element they have the same atomic or proton number.
the heavier isotope has a greater density and boiling point. 
However, because they have the same number of protons they have the same electronic structure and are identical chemically.
the three isotopes of hydrogen are called hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium.

Free electrons are electrons that are in incomplete valence shells and as a consequence, they can move freely from valence shell to valence shell of different atoms or compounds.
Electric current or current flow is the movement of electrons.
A conductor is a substance within which electrons can move freely from atom to atom or compound to compound.

~~~~~STATES OF MATTER~~~~~

4 common states of matter are solid, liquid, gas and plasma.
The compound(s) from which a substance is made do not change, regardless of the state of matter.
Atoms and molecules that make up a substance are always in motion due to heat energy in the material.
The state of matter is related to the motion between them.
Solid state has the least motion while gas and plasma have the most.

Plasma is made of ionized gas which itself is made of positive ions and free electrons, resulting in a relatively neutral electric charge.
It's particles are close enough together that they act collectively when exposed to a magnetic field.
It's also very electrically conductive.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MECHANICS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~STATICS~~~~~

Force is the influence tending to change the motion of a body or produce stress in a stationary body.
Stress is the effect of force acting on a stationary body or structure.
Force is measured in pounds or newtons.
When force is applied at a distance from the point at which the effects of the force are being considered, 
the force measurement includes a distance component such as pound-inches or newton-meters.
Force has magnitude and direction so it's represented by a vector.

The central point of an aircraft in aerodynamics is the center of lift, while in weight and balance it's the center of gravity.

The resultant is the consolidation of multiple vectors into a single vector.
Forces are coupled when two equal forces of opposite direction are applied to a body parallel to each other, as a consequence they produce a rotating force upon the body.
The resultant movement caused by the coupled force is known as torque.
Moment is the difference between an applied force and the reference point,
but a moment torque of coupled forces doesn't have a reference point, so it's a free vector.

~~~CENTER OF GRAVITY (CG)~~~

The center of gravity of an aircraft is the balance point of it.
The center of gravity is the point about which the weight of an airplane is concentrated.

An arm is a horizontal distance that a part is located from a reference point called the datum.
The datum is specified by the manufacturer.
The moment is the product of a weight (force) multiplied by its arm.
The moment for a piece of equipment installed on an aircraft is a torque value, measured in inch-pounds (in-lb) or newton-meters. 
Maintenance personnel are required to incorporate center of gravity considerations during routine inspections as well as when the aircraft is modified with new equipment.
Flight personnel must also insure the CG remains within safe limits when loading passengers, baggage and fuel.

~~~ELEMENTS OF THEORY OF STRESS~~~

Stress is the internal resistance to deformation.
The 5 major stresses to which all aircraft are subjected are: Tension, compression, torsion, shear and bending.

Tension is the stress that resists a force that tends to pull something apart (stretch).
The tensile strength of a material is measured in pounds per square inch (psi), 
and is calculated by dividing the load (in pounds) required to pull the material apart by its cross-sectional area (in square inches).

Compression is the stress that resists a crushing force.
The compressive strength of a material is measured in psi.

Torsion is the stress that resists twisting.
The torsion strength of a material is its resistance to twisting or torque.

Shear is the stress that resists the force tending to cause one layer of a material to slide over an adjacent layer.

Bending stress is a combination of compression and tension, 
because when something is bent it is compressed on the inside of the bend and stretched on the outside.

~~~STRAIN~~~

When an object becomes distorted by an applied force, the object is said to be strained, whether in plastic or elastic deformation.
A deflecting beam torque wrench uses the strain on the drive end of the wrench, 
and the resulting distortion of the beam to indicate the amount of torque on a bolt or nut.

~~~~~NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER~~~~~

~~~SOLID~~~

Matter is said to be solid when it has a definite volume and shape. 
They are incompressible and do not contain enough movement of the molecules to permit a physical change of shape.

~~~LIQUID~~~

Liquid matter is characterized by molecules that have more energy and increased movement. 
This causes the molecules to be able flow and not take a rigid shape such as a solid. 
Liquids take the shape of their container even though the volume of a liquid does not change significantly. 
Liquids are said to be incompressible.
The molecules are also closely bound enough to each other that surface tension is created.

~~~GAS~~~

Gases take the shape of their container but unlike liquids, gases are compressible. 
When pressure is applied, the molecules can be made to exist closer to each other.
It is possible to put a gas under so much pressure that is changes to a liquid state.

~~~CHANGES BETWEEN STATES~~~

Matter can change between the states by adding or removing energy.
For example when heat energy is added to water, 
water vapor is formed as the motion of the molecules causes more freedom of movement between molecules.
The heat energy added or subtracted to a substance is typically measured by temperature. 
The higher the temperature of a substance, the more energy it contains. 
Heat always flows from hot to cold. 
These terms express the relative amount of energy present in two substances, they do not measure the absolute amount of heat present.
Without a difference in energy levels, there is no transfer of energy (heat).
Adding heat to a substance does not always raise its temperature. 
When a substance changes state, such as when a liquid changes into a vapor, heat energy is absorbed. 
This is called latent heat. 
When a vapor condenses into a liquid, this heat energy is given off.
The temperature of a substance remains constant during its change of state. 
All energy absorbed or given off, the latent heat, is used for the change process. 
Once the change of state is complete, heat added to a substance raises the temperature of the substance. 
After a substance changes state into a vapor, the rise in temperature of the vapor caused by the addition of still more heat is called superheat.
The temperature at which a substance changes from a liquid into a vapor when heat is added is known as its boiling point. 
This is the same temperature at which a vapor condenses into a liquid when heat is removed.
When pressure on a liquid is increased, its boiling point increases, and when pressure on a liquid is decreased, its boiling point also decreases.
Water boils at 212 °F at normal atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psi.
At 20 psi it boils at 226.4 °F.
At 10 psi it boils at 194 °F.
Vapor pressure is the pressure of the vapor that exists above a liquid that is in an enclosed container at any given temperature. 
A substance that is said to be volatile, develops high vapor pressure at standard day temperature (59 °F).

~~~PRESSURE AND BUOYANCY~~~

~BUOYANCY~

The weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³
The weight density of air is 0.07651 lb/ft³
Buoyant force is an upward force that any fluid exerts on a body submerged in it.
Archimedes’ principle is that the buoyant force which a fluid exerts upon a submerged body is equal to the weight of the fluid the body displaces.
Buoyant force = volume of object × density of fluid displaced
A 10-ft³ object weighing 700 lbs is placed in pure water. Will the object float?
Buoyant force = 10 × 62.4 = 624lbs which is less than 700, so the object will sink.

~FLUID PRESSURE~

The pressure exerted on the bottom of a container by a liquid is determined by the height of the liquid and not by the shape of the container.
One gallon of water weighs 8.34 lb.
Pressure based on the column height of a fluid is known as static pressure.
With liquids, such as gasoline, it is sometimes referred to as a head of pressure.
For example, if a carburetor needs to have 2 psi supplied to its inlet (head of pressure), 
this could be accomplished by having the fuel tank positioned the appropriate number of inches higher than the carburetor.
When a fluid is in motion, and its velocity is converted to pressure, that pressure is known as ram. 
When ram pressure and static pressure are added together, the result is known as total pressure.
In the inlet of a gas turbine engine, for example, 
total pressure is often measured to provide a signal to the fuel metering device or to provide a signal to a gauge on the flight deck.
On a standard day at sea level, if a 1 square inch column of air extending to the top of the atmosphere is weighed, it would weigh 14.7 lb. 
That is why standard day atmospheric pressure is said to be 14.7 pounds per square inch (14.7 psi).
Atmospheric pressure is often measured by a mercury barometer. 
A glass tube somewhat over 30 inches in length is sealed at one end and then filled with mercury. 
It is then inverted and the open end placed in a dish of mercury. 
Immediately, the mercury level in the inverted tube will drop a short distance, 
leaving a small volume of mercury vapor at nearly zero absolute pressure in the tube just above the top of the liquid mercury column. 
Gravity acting on the mercury in the tube will try to make the mercury run out. 
Atmospheric pressure pushing down on the mercury in the open container tries to make the mercury stay in the tube. 
At some point these two forces (gravity and atmospheric pressure) will equalize and the mercury will stabilize at a certain height in the tube. 
Under standard day atmospheric conditions, the air in a 1 square inch column extending to the top of the atmosphere weighs 14.7 lb. 
A 1 square inch column of mercury, 29.92 inches tall, also weighs 14.7 lb. 
That is why 14.7 psi is equal to 29.92 "Hg when referring to a barometric reading.
A second means of measuring atmospheric pressure is with an aneroid barometer. 
This mechanical instrument is a much better choice than a mercury barometer for use on airplanes. 
Aneroid barometers (altimeters) are used to indicate altitude in flight.
The pressure of the atmosphere is exerted against an thin metal aneroid connected to the pointer.
Calibrations are made in thousands of feet rather than in psi or inches of mercury. 
For example, the standard pressure at sea level is 29.92 "Hg, or 14.7 psi. 
At 10,000 feet above sea level, standard pressure is 20.58 "Hg, or 10.10 psi. 
Altimeters are calibrated so that if the pressure exerted by the atmosphere is 10.10 psi, the altimeter will point to 10,000 ft.
