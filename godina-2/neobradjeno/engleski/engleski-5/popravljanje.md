Kriminal


Crime drama has always held a fascination for the public; 
now TV viewers have made forensics drama CSI the most watched TV show in the world. 
But what is it really like to work in Forensics? Forensic photographer Robert Mars provides some clues...
I see forensic photography as a way to show the truth. 
Whatever the story, a photograph can document a crime scene far better than anyone could describe it in court. 
But the job isn't always the way it appears on TV: 
I don't only deal with murder cases. 
During the course of one day I could be photographing anything from the scene of a robbery, a recovered stolen car, a burnt out house or a fatal road accident.

I usually work from 8 until 4 every weekday, but I'm on call 7 days a week. 
All the incidents I need to cover are gathered together at the Police Communications Centre and then sent over to me. 
The officer-in-charge will have briefed me on the crime before I begin my work at the scene. 
All the evidence must be photographed before O Police officers can take it away. 
If it's a murder investigation, I also photograph the victim before the body is removed by the medical examiner.

My photos are used to aid investigations and as evidence in court so every detail must be clearly visible 5 to provide an accurate picture. 
I start by illuminating the scene with key lights and usually I use a flash. 
If I'm photographing a room, I work with a wide angle lens on my camera to take an overall view from each corner and also from overhead. 
Then, using a zoom lens, I focus on O individual details in context. 
For example, the distance between a discarded knife and a table could be crucial in a murder investigation. 
Finally, I take close-up images of key pieces of evidence. 
Each photograph gets listed in a photo log which includes a description of the object and the time and date the photo was taken.

I was inspired to follow this career because of my interest in the technical side of photography. 
However, because I'm focused on showing facts, there's no room for experimentation with images. 
A clear eye is always required and that's a big challenge because this job can be very 4 tough on a personal level. 
For my peace of mind, I must be as detached as possible from what I witness. 
At times, though, it's essential to talk about the emotional impact this work can have and all the photographers on our team are encouraged to talk to a psychologist every three months.

Forensic photography is a specialist field, and there are only a small number of opportunities made available each year. 
Anyone who's interested in forensics must have had previous experience as a police officer. 
I'm pleased to have learnt so much more about photography in this job. 
If you can stay calm and focused while dealing with the unpredictable, then this could be a job to consider. 
You never get bored. 
Only don't expect it to be like CSI every day!


Robot


It is only one metre high. 
It looks and behaves like a human child of about three. 
It can crawl and sit up. 
It can even play the drums. 
What is it? 
It's the iCub robot - the latest in artificial intelligence and technology! 
The humanoid iCub robot was created by scientists at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, Italy, in order to understand how human children learn about the world around them. 
This is important because scientists believe that once they understand how human beings learn, they will be able to apply these principles to robots.

How can a robot teach scientists about how humans learn? 
Well, many scientists believe that one way humans learn is by physically interacting with objects and other humans. 
So, by building a robot with a physique that is as human as possible, scientists can study how our physical form helps us develop our learning abilities.

Well, it has a large number of motors in its body that generate movement in the head, arms, hands and legs. 
It has cameras for eyes and it listens with two tiny microphones on its head that record sounds. 
This enables the iCub to crawl, walk and even pick up objects in its hand in a similar way to a toddler.

On the outside, the iCub looks like a small child. 
However, a child will interact with interest to what it sees. 
The iCub robot has only just managed to 'learn' how to control its eye movements based on external stimuli. 
That's a long way from being able to learn by interacting with its surroundings the way a child does.


If so, you could be in for a long wait! Nevertheless, the iCub - and robots like it - demonstrate that one day it should be possible to introduce 'thinking' robots into the workplace.
Places such as hospitals and residential care homes could use these robots to assist with patient care. 
If the iCub experiment succeeds, many busy doctors and nurses will get a helping hand with their workload. 
Meanwhile, the iCub research team are patiently waiting and watching - much like normal parents - to see how their 'child' learns as it grows up!
