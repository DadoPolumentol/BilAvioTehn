Purpose of forensic photography:
    To show the truth.
    Photos document crime scenes better than verbal descriptions.
    Used as evidence in court.

Reality vs TV:
    Not only murder cases.
    Could involve robbery scenes, stolen cars, burnt houses, or road accidents.

Work schedule:
    Works 8–4 on weekdays, but on call 7 days a week.

Process:
    Incidents are assigned via the Police Communications Centre.
    Officer-in-charge briefs the photographer.
    All evidence must be photographed before removal.
    In murder cases, the victim is photographed before the body is removed.

Photography method:
    Key lights and flash are used to illuminate the scene.
    Uses a wide angle lens for general room shots (each corner + overhead).
    Then uses a zoom lens for contextual details.
    Close-up photos are taken of key evidence.
    Example: distance between knife and table can be crucial.

Photo documentation:
    Each photo is listed in a photo log.
    The log includes a description, time, and date.

Motivation:
    Inspired by interest in the technical side of photography.

Work approach:
    No room for experimentation – focus is on facts.
    Requires a clear and objective eye.

Emotional challenges:
    Job can be mentally tough.
    Must stay detached from what is witnessed.
    Photographers speak to a psychologist every 3 months to cope with emotional impact.

Career requirements:
    Few opportunities in forensic photography.
    Must have previous police experience.

Skills and traits needed:
    Ability to stay calm, focused, and handle unpredictable situations.
    It’s a specialist field and never boring, but not like CSI.

Basic info:
    1 metre high, looks like a 3-year-old child.
    Can crawl, sit up, and play drums.

Purpose:
    Created by Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, Italy.
    Designed to help understand how children learn.
    Goal: Apply human learning principles to robots.

Learning method:
    Humans learn by physically interacting with objects/people.
    Robot has human-like physique to study how physical form supports learning.

Technical features:
    Has many motors for movement (head, arms, hands, legs).
    Uses cameras for eyes, microphones for ears.
    Can crawl, walk, and pick up objects like a toddler.

Appearance vs. behavior:
    iCub looks like a child, but does not interact with interest like real children.
    It has only just learned to control eye movements based on external stimuli.

Learning limitations:
    Still far from learning by interacting with surroundings like a human child.

Future potential:
    iCub and similar robots could become 'thinking' robots in the future.
    Possible use in hospitals and care homes to assist doctors and nurses.
    The research team observes iCub like parents, watching how it 'learns' and develops.
