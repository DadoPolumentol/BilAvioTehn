Relative clause begins with a relative pronoun like who, which, that, whose, or whom. 

Example: "The book that you lent me is great."
    "that you lent me" is the relative clause

There are two types:
Defining relative clauses (They give essential information): The person who called is my friend
Non-defining relative clauses(They add extra information and are set off by commas ): My brother, who lives in New York, is visiting.

Comparisons: positive(fast), comparative(faster), superlative(the fastest)
