5th June at 7:45, IAF Operation Focus, 200 operational jets, 12 not launched and rest launched a mass attack to destroy Egyptian airfields, no hardened aircraft shelters.
IAF planes low over the Mediterranean sea or the Red sea.

Egyptians shut down air defense systems, fear that rebel Egyptian forces would shoot down the plane with Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer and Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud, en route from al Maza to Bir Tamada, Sinai to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there.

IAF mixed-attack strategy: bombing and strafing runs against planes parked on the ground, and bombing runways with tarmac-shredding penetration bombs, surviving aircraft unable to take off.

Operation was successful in destroying virtually all of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground, few Israeli losses. 

4 unarmed Egyptian training flights were in the air when the strike began. 338 Egyptian aircraft were destroyed and 100 pilots killed.

IAF lost 19 planes, 2 in air-to-air combat, 13 by anti-aircraft artillery.

	surprise the Egyptian forces in timing (attack coinciding with the IAF strike on airfields), 
	in location (via northern and central Sinai routes, opposed to the Egyptian expectations of a repeat of the 1956 war, when they attacked via the central and southern routes) 
	and method (combined-force flanking approach, rather than direct tank assaults).

Mirage III is a supersonic fighter developed by French company Dassault Aviation. 
Entered service in the early 1960s, single-engine, delta wing that gives it great manoeuvrability and enables it to reach very high speeds, in excess of Mach 2. 
15 metre length and 8.22 metre wingspan, designed for air superiority, interception and ground support missions.
IAF acquired several Mirage IIIs (known locally as Shahaks) in the early 60s. 
Adapted to Israel’s requirements, modifications to the navigation and communications equipment. 
Atar 9B engine, maximum power of 60 kN on afterburner, enabling it to climb rapidly to intercept enemy aircraft at high altitude.



While the other Mirage IIIs were executing Operation Focus, 12 of them were deployed to defend the Israel itself.
4 were permanently in the sky, while 8 were at high readiness on the ground.
After neutralising the Egyptian air force, the Mirage IIIs were redeployed to attack Syrian and Jordanian forces.
In addition to bombing and interception missions, the Mirage IIIs also carried out reconnaissance missions, monitoring enemy troop movements. 
Out of a claimed total of 58 Arab aircraft shot down in air combat during the conflict, 48 were by the Mirage pilots.
Limited range and lack of in-flight refueling restricted operational flexibility, especially over Syria. 
Due to its weak ground attack capability required support from other aircraft like the A-4 Skyhawk for strike missions.
