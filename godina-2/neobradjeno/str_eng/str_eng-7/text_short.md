**Apron (Ramp) \[ICAO]:**
Defined area on a land aerodrome for loading/unloading passengers, mail, cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance.

**Ramp Services:**

1. **Aircraft Marshalling:**

* Visual signaling between ground personnel and pilots to guide aircraft in/out of parking.
* Alternative or additional to radio communication.
* Marshaller wears reflective vest, helmet with earmuffs, illuminated gloves or beacons.
* Signals include: turn, slow down, stop, engine shutdown, parking guidance.
* Sometimes uses "Follow-Me" car (yellow with checkerboard), but not industry standard.
* On aircraft carriers/helipads, marshallers give take-off and landing clearances due to limited space/time.

2. **Towing and Pushback:**

* **Towing:** Pulling aircraft with a chain, bar, etc.
* **Pushback:** Pushing aircraft backwards from gate by external vehicle (pushback tractor/tug) when aircraft cannot turn by itself.

**Pushback Types:**

* **Walkout:** Tractor driver + walkout assistant; assistant communicates with cockpit and ensures safety during pushback and engine start.
* **Single Man Pushback:** Tractor driver alone handles communication and safety, faster and more economical.

**Tractor Types:**

* **Towbar Tractor:**

  * Uses a towbar attached to aircraft nose landing gear.
  * Aircraft moves like a two-axle trailer with rotating hitch.
  * Towbar has fracture point for overload safety, so cockpit must be manned to stop aircraft if towbar breaks.

* **Towbarless Tractor:**

  * Raises and locks aircraft nose gear on tractor platform.
  * Moves aircraft like single-axle trailer, faster towing.
  * Safer (no towbar fracture risk).
  * More flexible: no need to change incompatible towbars for different aircraft types.
  * Reduces vehicle running time and fuel consumption.



**3. Lavatory Drainage:**

* Lavatory service vehicles empty and refill aircraft lavatory waste tanks.
* Waste is stored onboard until emptied by these vehicles.
* Some airports use smaller lavatory carts pulled by tugs instead of self-powered vehicles.
* Lavatory tanks are refilled with a water and disinfectant mixture called "blue juice."

**4. Water Cartage:**

* Potable water trucks fill aircraft drinking water tanks.
* Water is filtered and protected while stored in the vehicle.
* A pump transfers water from truck to aircraft.

**5. Engine Start-up:**

* Air starter vehicles have built-in gas turbine engines providing compressed air for starting aircraft engines.
* Aircraft compressors alone cannot supply enough air for start-up; the air starter supplies air via a hose connected to the aircraft.

**6. Air Conditioning:**

* External air conditioning units heat or cool aircraft interiors on the ground for technical or energy-saving reasons.
* These units feed air into the aircraftâ€™s ventilation system through special hose connections.
* **Pre-Conditioned Air Unit (Terminal):** Permanently fixed in the aerobridge (sometimes called "Pop-up Pit"), used when aircraft is parked next to terminal.
* Other forms include truck-mounted cooling systems.

**7. Ground Power Unit (GPU):**

* GPU vehicles supply electrical power to aircraft on the ground.
* GPUs can also be built into jetways.
* Aircraft require 28V DC and 200V, 400Hz AC power.
* Power is transferred via thick, standard connectors and cables.


**8. Refuelling:**

* **Overwing fuelling:** For smaller planes, helicopters, piston-engine aircraft. Fuel poured directly into fuel tanks after removing caps (like car fuelling).
* **Underwing fuelling (single-point/pressure refuelling):** For larger aircraft and jet fuel only. High-pressure hose pumps fuel into aircraft.
* **Aircraft refuelers:** Vehicles with fuel tanks filled at airport fuel farms.
* **Hydrant Dispensers (Hydrant Servicers):** For airports with underground pipeline hydrant systems; no onboard fuel tank; connect hydrant pit to aircraft; high flow rates (up to 4000 L/min).
* **In-flight refuelling (aerial refuelling):** Fuel transfer from tanker aircraft to receiver aircraft during flight.

**9. De-icing and Anti-icing:**

* **De-icing:** Removal of frozen contaminants (snow, ice, slush) by mechanical means, heat, chemicals (heated, diluted de-icing fluids like salts, alcohols, glycols), or combined methods.
* **Anti-icing:** Applying viscous protective fluid (anti-ice fluid) to prevent frozen contaminant formation. Protection is limited by contaminant type and precipitation.
* When anti-ice fluid fails (cannot absorb contaminant), it must be washed off using de-icing fluid.

**10. Luggage Handling:**

* **Baggage tractors/tow tractors:** Tow luggage carts between terminal and aircraft.
* **Baggage carts:** Transport luggage, mail, cargo; have brakes that engage when not attached to tractor.
* **Belt loaders/mobile conveyor belts:** Vehicles with movable belts to load/unload baggage and cargo; used mainly for bulk loading on smaller aircraft without containers.

**11. Air Cargo Handling:**

* **Container loader:** Used for wide-bodied aircraft cargo platforms.
* Has two independently moving platforms that raise/lower.
* Cargo containers or pallets move on built-in rollers or wheels across platforms into/out of aircraft.







**Cargo Trolleys / Dollies:**

* Used to transport loads placed in containers and on pallets.
* Come in various sizes and shapes depending on usage.

**Cool Container:**

* Air cargo container with ventilation, cooling by dry ice stored in a separate bunker, plus electric heating and continuous air circulation.
* Regulates temperature within cargo compartment.

**Cool Dolly:**

* Developed for safe transport and storage of perishable shipments in hot climates when shipments arrive in regular containers/pallets (not cool containers).
* Steel trailer with aluminum insulated container on top, equipped with compressor-driven cooling system.
* Regulates temperature within a specific range; can cool or heat depending on environment.
* Can load, unload, and transport various aircraft pallets and containers.

**Forklift:**

* Powered industrial truck used to lift, transport, and stack heavy materials.
* At airports, used mainly in cargo warehouses and limited airside areas.

**Beacon:**

* A light used to guide vehicles and warn them of danger.
