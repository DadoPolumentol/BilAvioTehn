What is an apron or ramp according to ICAO, and what is its purpose?

An apron or ramp is a defined area on a land aerodrome intended to accommodate aircraft for loading/unloading passengers, mail, or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance.

What services are provided on the ramp or apron?

Services on the ramp/apron include aircraft marshalling, refueling, loading/unloading passengers and cargo, parking, and maintenance.

What is aircraft marshalling?

Aircraft marshalling is visual signaling between ground personnel and pilots to guide aircraft into and out of parking positions; it is part of ground handling and can supplement or replace radio communications.

What equipment does a marshaller typically wear?

A marshaller typically wears a reflective safety vest, a helmet with acoustic earmuffs, and uses illuminated beacons or gloves.

What signals does a marshaller give to the pilot at airports?

The marshaller signals the pilot to keep turning, slow down, stop, shut down engines, and leads the aircraft to the parking stand or runway.

What is a "Follow-Me" car, and how is it used?

A "Follow-Me" car is usually a yellow minivan with a checkerboard pattern used by a marshaller to lead an aircraft to its parking position before disembarking and resuming hand signals; this is not an industry standard.

How do marshallers operate on aircraft carriers or helipads?

On aircraft carriers or helipads, marshallers give take-off and landing clearances visually due to limited space and time, where radio communication is difficult.

What is towing in aviation and what is pushback?

Towing is pulling an aircraft behind another vehicle using a chain or bar. Pushback is an airport procedure where an aircraft is pushed backward away from the gate by external power when there isn't enough room to turn under its own power.

What vehicles are used for pushback operations?
