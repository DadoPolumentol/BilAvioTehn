Apron (Ramp) [ICAO]:

Area at an aerodrome for loading/unloading passengers, cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance.

Ramp Services: 

Aircraft Marshalling, Towing and Pushback

Aircraft Marshalling:

Visual signals guiding aircraft during parking; marshaller wears reflective vest, helmet, illuminated gloves/beacons; sometimes uses "Follow-Me" car; also used on carriers/helipads for take-off/landing clearance.

Towing: 

Pulling aircraft with chain/bar.

Pushback: 

Pushing aircraft backward using a tractor when it can't turn itself.

Pushback Types:
    Walkout: Tractor driver + assistant for communication and safety.
    Single Man Pushback: Tractor driver alone handles everything; faster.

Tractor Types:
    Towbar Tractor: Uses towbar attached to nose gear; must have cockpit manned due to towbar fracture risk.
    Towbarless Tractor: Lifts and locks nose gear; faster, safer, no towbar needed, more flexible and efficient.

Lavatory Drainage:

Vehicles empty and refill aircraft lavatory waste tanks; some airports use smaller carts pulled by tugs; tanks refilled with "blue juice" (water + disinfectant).

Water Cartage:

Potable water trucks fill aircraft drinking water tanks with filtered, protected water using a pump.

Engine Start-up:

Air starter vehicles provide compressed air via hose to start aircraft engines; aircraft compressors alone can't supply enough air.

Air Conditioning:

External units heat/cool aircraft on ground, feeding air through hoses; Pre-Conditioned Air Units fixed in aerobridges ("Pop-up Pit"); also truck-mounted systems.

Ground Power Unit (GPU):

Supplies electrical power (28V DC, 200V 400Hz AC) to aircraft on ground; can be vehicle-mounted or built into jetways; uses standard connectors and thick cables.

 Refuelling:
    Overwing fuelling: smaller aircraft, fuel poured directly after removing caps.
    Underwing fuelling (single-point): larger aircraft, fuel pumped under pressure via hose.
    Aircraft refuelers: vehicles filled at airport fuel farms.
    Hydrant dispensers: connect underground pipeline hydrant system to aircraft, high flow (up to 4000 L/min).
    In-flight refuelling: tanker aircraft refuels another in flight.

De-icing and Anti-icing:
    De-icing: removal of frozen contaminants by heat, chemicals, or mechanical means.
    Anti-icing: applying fluid to prevent ice formation; limited protection; must wash off failed anti-ice with de-icing fluid.

Luggage Handling:
    Baggage tractors: tow luggage carts.
    Baggage carts: transport luggage/mail/cargo; brakes engage when detached.
    Belt loaders: movable belts to load/unload bulk baggage and cargo, mainly for small aircraft without containers.

Air Cargo Handling:
    Container loader: used for wide-body aircraft cargo; two moving platforms raise/lower cargo.
    Cargo containers/pallets move on rollers or wheels across platforms into/out of aircraft.

Cargo Trolleys/Dollies:
    Transport loads in containers and pallets.
    Various sizes and shapes for different uses.

Cool Container:
    Air cargo container with ventilation.
    Cools using dry ice in separate bunker, electric heating, and air circulation.
    Regulates internal cargo temperature.

Cool Dolly:
    Transports/stores perishable shipments in hot climates (for regular containers/pallets).
    Steel trailer with insulated aluminum container and compressor cooling system.
    Can both cool and heat; regulates temperature within set range.
    Handles loading/unloading of pallets and containers.

Forklift:
    Powered truck to lift, move, stack heavy materials.
    Used mainly in cargo warehouses and some airside areas.

Beacon:
    Light used to guide vehicles and warn of danger.


The service for preparing food for aircraft is: Catering

Budget airline is: a low-cost carrier

Airline meals are typically delivered in: Trolleys

Process of reducing the moisture in the air is: Dehumidification
