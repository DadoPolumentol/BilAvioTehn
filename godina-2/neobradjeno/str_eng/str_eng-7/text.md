RAMP SERVICES AND GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (GSE)
APRON OR RAMP [ICAO] is a defined area, on a land aerodrome, intended to accommodate aircraft for purposes of loading or unloading passengers, mail or cargo, refueling, parking or maintenance
Services on the ramp or apron include:
1. Aircraft marshalling (guiding the aircraft into and out of the parking position)
Aircraft marshalling is visual signaling between ground personnel and pilots on an airport, aircraft carrier or helipad.
Marshalling is one-on-one visual communication and a part of aircraft ground handling. It may be as an alternative to, or additional to, radio communications between the aircraft and air traffic control. The usual attire of a marshaller is a reflecting safety vest, a helmet with acoustic earmuffs, and illuminated beacons or gloves. On airports, the marshaller signals the pilot to keep turning, slow down, stop, and shut down engines, leading the aircraft to its parking stand or to the runway. Sometimes, the marshaller indicates directions to the pilot by driving a "Follow-Me" car (usually a yellow minivan with a checkerboard pattern) prior to disembarking and resuming signaling. This, however, is not an industry standard.
On aircraft carriers or helipads, marshallers give take-off and landing clearances to aircraft and helicopters, where the very limited space and time between take-offs and landings makes radio communications a difficult alternative.


2. Towing with pushback tractors
Towing is the process of pulling behind another vehicle using a chain, bar, etc.
In aviation pushback is an airport procedure during which an aircraft is pushed backwards away from an airport gate by external power, when there isn't enough room for the aircraft to turn under its own power (which requires some degree of forward motion). Pushbacks are carried out by special, low-profile vehicles called pushback tractors or tugs. It can be carried out as a walkout or as a single man pushback.
Walkout
In a walkout, the tractor driver is accompanied by a walkout assistant, who may be an employee of an airport or the airline. The walkout assistant handles communications between the tractor driver and the cockpit and is responsible for safety during pushback and engine start-up.
Single man pushback
Single man pushback - unlike a walkout - is handled by the tractor driver alone.
A walkout assistant is not required. The tractor driver is in direct contact with the cockpit and apron control, and also performs the tasks of the walkout assistant. This ensures a faster and more economical pushback.
Towbar tractors
When a towbar tractor performs pushback or towing operations, a towbar is attached to the nose landing gear of the aircraft and coupled to the tractor. The aircraft can then be moved like a two- axle trailer with a rotating hitch. Because the towbar is designed to break at a pre-defined fracture point in case of overloading, the cockpit of the aircraft must be manned to ensure that the aircraft can be stopped in this eventuality.
Towbarless tractors
A towbarless tractor raises the aircraft's nose landing gear and positions it on the tractor's transport platform. The landing gear is mechanically locked, securely attaching it to the tractor. The tractor now move the aircraft like a single-axle trailer coupled to can Locking in the nose gear makes it possible to perform the towing operation much faster than with a towbar tractor. In addition, towing without a towbar improves safety because there is no towbar that can fracture. Finally, towbarless tractors can be used more flexibly because there is no longer any need for the - usually incompatible - towbars for the various aircraft types. As a result, tractor drivers do not have to go to the central towbar storage area after every pushback operation to exchange towbars. This considerably reduces vehicle running times and fuel consumption.


3. Lavatory drainage
Lavatory service vehicles empty and refill lavatories onboard aircraft. Waste is stored in tanks on the aircraft until these vehicles can empty them and get rid of the waste. After tank is emptied, it is Instead of a self-powered vehicle, some airports have lavatory carts, which are smaller and must refilled with a mixture of water and a disinfecting concentrate, commonly called "blue juice". be pulled by tug.
4. Water cartage
Potable water trucks are special vehicles that fill up drinking water tanks in aircraft. The water is filtered and protected from the elements while being stored on the vehicle. A pump in the vehicle assists in moving the water from the truck to the aircraft.
5. Engine start-up
An air starter is a vehicle with a built-in gas turbine engine which, during the start of aircraft engine, gives the necessary quantity of air to start the engine. While a compressor cannot deliver the necessary quantity of air for its own work, the air is provided by an air starter. An air starter blows air in by a hose attached to aircraft.



6. Air conditioning
Depending on the weather, it may be necessary to heat or cool the interior of an aircraft while it is on the ground. Although aircraft have their own heating and cooling systems, it may be advisable for technical or energy conservation reasons to use external units. This equipment feeds warm or cool air into the aircraft's own ventilation system through a hose connected to special inlets on the aircraft.
Pre-Conditioned Air Unit (Terminal) is similar to that of an Air Condition Unit when it comes to function and purpose. The only difference with this equipment is that it is permanently fixed in an aerobridge. Sometimes it is called "Pop-up Pit" (underground pit system) as it is set up on the ground. The unit is effectively used when an aircraft is parked adjacent to the terminal building.

7. Ground Power Unit (GPU)
A ground power unit is a vehicle capable of supplying power to aircraft parked on the ground. Ground power units may also be built into the jetway, making it even easier to supply electrical power to aircraft. All aircraft require 28V of direct current and 200V 400Hz of alternating current. The electric energy is carried from a generator to a connection on the aircraft via a very thick cable. These connectors are standard for all aircraft.



8. Refuelling
Overwing fuelling is used on smaller planes, helicopters, and all piston-engine aircraft. Overwing fuelling is similar to car fuelling, the caps are removed and fuel is poured straight into the fuel
tanks.
Underwing fuelling, also called single-point refuelling or pressure refuelling, is used on larger aircraft and for jet fuel exclusively. For pressure refuelling, a high-pressure hose is attached and fuel is pumped in.
Aircraft refuelers are refuelling vehicles equipped with tanks filled at the airport fuel farms.

Hydrant Dispensers or Hydrant Servicers are designed for airports equipped with Hydrant Systems (underground pipelines). They do not carry fuel capacity on board but are connected between the airport hydrant pit system and the aircraft to perform the refuelling operation. These vehicles are mostly designed for large commercial airports as they offer high flow rates up to 4.000 L/min (1.000 USG/min).
IN-FLIGHT REFUELING AERIAL REFUELING
...is the process of transferring fuel from one aircraft (the tanker)
to another (the receiver) during flight.



9. De-icing and anti-acing
De-icing is the process of removing frozen contaminant, snow, ice, slush, from a surface. Anti-icing is the process of protecting against the formation of frozen contaminant, snow, ice, slush on a surface.
De-icing can be accomplished by mechanical methods (scraping, pushing); through the application of heat; by use of chemicals, known as de-icing fluids, designed to lower the freezing point of water (various salts, alcohols, glycols); or by a combination of these different techniques. De-icing fluids are always applied heated and diluted.
Anti-icing is accomplished by applying a protective layer, using a viscous fluid called anti-ice fluid, over a surface to absorb the contaminate. All anti-ice fluids offer only limited protection, dependent upon frozen contaminant type and precipitation rate. A fluid has failed when it no longer can absorb the contaminant and it essentially becomes a contaminant itself. If it fails it must be washed from the surface using a de-icing fluid.


10. Luggage handling
Baggage tractors are designed to tow luggage carts from the airport terminal building to the aircraft and vice-versa. They are also called tow tractors.
the
Baggage carts are used for transportation of luggage, mail, cargo and other materials between the aircraft and the terminal or sorting facility. Carts are fitted with a brake system which blocks the wheels from moving when the connecting rod is not attached to a tug.
Belt loaders or Mobile Conveyor Belts are vehicles with movable belts that allow for easy and fast unloading and loading of baggage and cargo. A belt loader is driven up to the open space in bottom of an aircraft, known as bin. They are used mostly on smaller aircraft that do not use containers. Baggage stored without containers is known as bulk loading.
11. Air cargo handling
Container loader
The loader for wide-bodied aircraft (cargo platform) is used for loading and unloading of cargo placed in containers or on pallet. The loader has two platforms which independently raise or come down. The containers or palettes on the loader are moved with the help of built-in rollers or wheels, and are carried in aircraft across the platforms.


Cargo trolleys or dollies are used for the transport of loads placed in containers and on pallets.
container dolly
cool container
Cool container is an air cargo container with a sophisticated ventilation system and integral large rechargeable accumulators.
It regulates the temperatures within the cargo compartment of the unit by using dry ice (concealed in separate dry ice bunker) as cooling energy source in combination with an electrical heating and permanent air circulation.
Cargo dollies come in different sizes and shapes. They also vary in their usage. For example, Emirates SkyCargo uses cool dollies. The cool dolly was developed to enable safe ramp transport and warehouse storage of perishable shipments in hot climates, when the shipment is received in regular air cargo containers or pallets (not in cool containers).
The cool dolly can regulate the temperature inside the dolly within a specific temperature range. It consists of a steel trailer and an aluminium insulated container built on top, the latter equipped with a compressor driven cooling system. The dolly is capable of loading, unloading and transporting various kinds of aircraft pallets and containers.
Despite its name, the cool dolly can actually heat
too!
This is to allow operations in colder environments.
A forklift, also called a lift truck, is a powered industrial truck used to lift, transport and stack heavy materials. In an airport environment, the use of a forklift is restricted to cargo warehouse operations and some specified areas at airside.
