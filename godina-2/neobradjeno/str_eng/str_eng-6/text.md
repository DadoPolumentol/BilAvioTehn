4 stroke cycle
	
1.Intake: begins at TDC dead center, and ends at BDC dead center. 
Intake valve open position, piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure. 
The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston. 
	
2.Compression: begins at BDC, ends at TDC. 
In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.

3.Combustion: Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at top	(the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture ignited a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by high compression generated heat (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to bottom. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft. 
	
4.Exhaust: Also known as outlet. During the exhaust stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.

Spark plug
The spark plug supplies the spark that ignites the air/fuel mixture so that combustion can occur. The spark must happen at just the right moment for things to work properly.

Valves
The intake and exhaust valves open at the proper time to let in air and fuel and to let out exhaust.
Note that both valves are closed during compression and combustion so that the combustion chamber is sealed.

Piston
A piston is a cylindrical piece of metal that moves up and down inside the cylinder. 

Piston Rings
Piston rings provide a sliding seal between the outer edge of the piston and the inner edge of the cylinder.

The rings serve two purposes:
They prevent the fuel/air mixture and exhaust in the combustion chamber from leaking into the sump during compression and combustion.
They keep oil in the sump from leaking into the combustion area, where it would be burned and lost.



Most vehicles that "burn oil" and have to have a quart added every 1,000 miles are burning it because the engine is old and the rings no longer seal things properly. Many modern vehicles use more advance materials for piston rings. That's one of the reasons why engines last longer and can go longer between oil changes.

Sump
The sump surrounds the crankshaft. It contains some amount of oil, which collects in the bottom of the sump (the oil pan).


Connecting rod
The connecting rod connects the piston to the crankshaft. 
It can rotate at both ends so that its angle can change as the piston and the crankshaft rotates.

Crankshaft
The crankshaft turns the piston's up-and-down motion into circular motion.

An intake valve is needed to let the fuel/air into the cylinder.

The cylinder forms a part of the chamber in which the fuel is compressed and burned.

The piston, moving within the cylinder, forms one of the walls of the combustin chamber. 

The piston has rings which seal the gases in the cylinder, preventing any loss of power around the sides of the piston.

An exhaust valve is needed to let the exhaust gases out.

The connecting rod forms a link between the piston and the crankshaft.

The crankshaft and connecting rod change the straight line motion of the piston to a rotary turning motion. 

The crankshaft in an aircraft engine also absorbs the power or work from all the cylinders and transfers it to the propeller.

Types of Aircraft Reciprocating Engines

The two primary reciprocating engine designs are the spark ignition and the compression ignition. 

The main mechanical components are essentially the same, the main difference between spark ignition and compression ignition is the process of igniting the fuel.

Spark ignition engines use a spark plug to ignite a pre-mixed fuel-air mixture. 

A compression ignition engine first compresses the air in the cylinder, raising its temperature to a degree necessary for automatic ignition when fuel is injected into the cylinder.

These two engine designs can be further classified as:

1. Cylinder arrangement with respect to the crankshaft-radial, in-line, v-type, or opposed 
2. Operating cycle-two or four
3. Method of cooling-liquid or air


Cylinder arrangement with respect to the crankshaft

Radial engine has one or more rows of cylinders arranged in a circle around a centrally-located crankcase. 

Each row must have an odd number of cylinders in order to produce smooth operation. 

The cylinders seem to "radiate" outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel. (It's even called a "star engine" in some languages). 

The main advantage of a radial engine is the favorable power-to-weight ratio.

In-line engine has cylinders lined up in one row. 

It typically has an even number of cylinders, but there are instances of three- and five-cylinder engines. 

The biggest advantage of this engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a narrow frontal area for low drag. 

The disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio. 

because the crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy. 



If the engine crankshaft is located above the cylinders, it is called an inverted inline engine, which allows the propeller to be mounted up high for ground clearance even with short landing gear. 

An in-line engine may be either air cooled or liquid cooled, but liquid-cooling is more common because it is difficult to get enough air-flow to cool the rear cylinders directly. 

Inline engines were common in early aircraft, including the Wright Flyer, the aircraft that made the first controlled powered flight. 

However, the disadvantages of the design soon became apparent, and the inline design was abandoned, becoming a rarity in modern aviation. 

V-type engines provide more horsepower than in-line engines and still retain a small frontal area.

In V-type engines, the cylinders are arranged in two in-line banks generally set 60° apart. 

The vast majority of V engines are water-cooled. 

This type of engine was used mostly during the second World War and its use is mostly limited to older aircraft.

Horizontally opposed engines are often referred to as boxer or flat engines. 

Continued improvements in engine design led to the development of this type of engine, which remains the most popular reciprocating engine used on smaller aircraft. 

These engines always have an even number of cylinders, since a cylinder on one side of the crankcase "opposes" a cylinder on the other side. 

The majority of these engines are air cooled and usually are mounted in a horizontal position when installed on fixed-wing airplanes. 

Opposed-type engines have high power-to-weight ratios because they have a comparatively small, lightweight crankcase. 

In addition, the compact cylinder arrangement reduces the engine's frontal area and allows a streamlined installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag.

Piston engines drive a spinning shaft. 

The propeller is attached to that shaft. 

At least two (but usually three or four) blades make up the propeller.

In most applications of steam power today, the piston engine has been replaced by the more efficient turbine.



4 stroke five event cycle is called Otto cycle.
5 events are strokes + ignition event.
Other cycles are Carnot, Diesel, Brayton cycle.
By Nicolas-Leonard-Sadi Carnot, Rudolf Diesel, George Brayton.
All cycles have compression of air, burning fuel in compressed air, conversion of pressure and heat into power.
Carnot cycle: 
	Engine accepts heat from high temperature source and converts part of it into mechanical or electrical work and rejects remainder into low-temperature sink. > difference in temperature = > efficiency.
Brayton / continous combustion cycle:
	4 constant and continous events (intake, compression, expansion + power, exhaust)
Diesel cycle:
	Compression ignition











PUSKE                                      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Piston / internal combustion engine is engine that uses pistons to convert pressure into rotating motion.
It drives a spinning shaft that rotates min 2, ave 3-4 propeller blades.
They combust petrol, diesel, natural gas.
By ignition:
	Spark ignition uses spark to ignite premixed.
	Compression ignition compressed air to temperature for automatic ignition.
By cylinder arrangement:
	Radial 1/> cylinders arranged in circle, each row has an odd number of cylinders, good power-to-weight ration
	In-line cylinders in a row, enables narrow frontal area design for low drag, poor power-to-weight because crankcase + crankshaft are too heavy. If crankshaft is above cylinders, it is inverted in-line engine, which allows propeller to be mounted up high for ground clearance. Usually liquid cooled, bad airflow.
	V-type > horsepower than in-line and small frontal area. Cylinders in 2 in-line banks 60° apart. Mostly water cooled. Used in WW2.
	Horizontally opposed / boxer / flat most popular piston on smaller aircraft. Even number of cylinders. Air cooled. High power-to-weight because small crankcase. Small frontal area.
By cooling method:
4 stroke:
	Intake: TDC(up) to BDC(down)
	Compression: BDC to TDC
	Combustion: TDC BDC + spark plug
	Exhaust: BDC TDC
4 stroke five event is Otto cycle.
5 events = strokes + ignition.
Carnot cycle: 
	Engine take heat from high temp and convert most into mechanical / electrical work, other into low temp sink. > temp difference = > efficiency
Brayton / continous combustion cycle:
	4 constant and continous events (intake, compression, expansion + power, exhaust)
Diesel cycle:
	Compression ignition
Piston rings provide a seal between outer piston and inner cylinder.
Rings prevent air/fuel from coming into sump and oil from coming into combustion chamber
Connecting rod connect piston and crankshaft
Crankshaft convert pistons up-and-down into circular and transfers power to propeller.
Cylinder forms a part of the chamber in which the fuel is compressed and burned.
Piston engine is replaced by turbine in most cases.
