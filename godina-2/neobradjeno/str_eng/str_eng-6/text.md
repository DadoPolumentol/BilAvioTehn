Spark plug
The spark plug supplies the spark that ignites the air/fuel mixture so that combustion can occur. The spark must happen at just the right moment for things to work properly.

Valves
The intake and exhaust valves open at the proper time to let in air and fuel and to let out exhaust.
Note that both valves are closed during compression and combustion so that the combustion chamber is sealed.

Piston
A piston is a cylindrical piece of metal that moves up and down inside the cylinder. 

Piston Rings
Piston rings provide a sliding seal between the outer edge of the piston and the inner edge of the cylinder.

The rings serve two purposes:
They prevent the fuel/air mixture and exhaust in the combustion chamber from leaking into the sump during compression and combustion.
They keep oil in the sump from leaking into the combustion area, where it would be burned and lost.

Most vehicles that "burn oil" and have to have a quart added every 1,000 miles are burning it because the engine is old and the rings no longer seal things properly. Many modern vehicles use more advance materials for piston rings. That's one of the reasons why engines last longer and can go longer between oil changes.

Sump
The sump surrounds the crankshaft. It contains some amount of oil, which collects in the bottom of the sump (the oil pan).


Connecting rod
The connecting rod connects the piston to the crankshaft. 
It can rotate at both ends so that its angle can change as the piston and the crankshaft rotates.

Crankshaft
The crankshaft turns the piston's up-and-down motion into circular motion.

An intake valve is needed to let the fuel/air into the cylinder.

The cylinder forms a part of the chamber in which the fuel is compressed and burned.

The piston, moving within the cylinder, forms one of the walls of the combustin chamber. 

The piston has rings which seal the gases in the cylinder, preventing any loss of power around the sides of the piston.

An exhaust valve is needed to let the exhaust gases out.

The connecting rod forms a link between the piston and the crankshaft.

The crankshaft and connecting rod change the straight line motion of the piston to a rotary turning motion. 

The crankshaft in an aircraft engine also absorbs the power or work from all the cylinders and transfers it to the propeller.

Types of Aircraft Reciprocating Engines

The two primary reciprocating engine designs are the spark ignition and the compression ignition. 

The main mechanical components are essentially the same, the main difference between spark ignition and compression ignition is the process of igniting the fuel.

Spark ignition engines use a spark plug to ignite a pre-mixed fuel-air mixture. 

A compression ignition engine first compresses the air in the cylinder, raising its temperature to a degree necessary for automatic ignition when fuel is injected into the cylinder.

These two engine designs can be further classified as:

1. Cylinder arrangement with respect to the crankshaft-radial, in-line, v-type, or opposed 
2. Operating cycle-two or four
3. Method of cooling-liquid or air

Cylinder arrangement with respect to the crankshaft

Radial engine has one or more rows of cylinders arranged in a circle around a centrally-located crankcase. 

Each row must have an odd number of cylinders in order to produce smooth operation. 

The cylinders seem to "radiate" outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel. (It's even called a "star engine" in some languages). 

The main advantage of a radial engine is the favorable power-to-weight ratio.

In-line engine has cylinders lined up in one row. 

It typically has an even number of cylinders, but there are instances of three- and five-cylinder engines. 

The biggest advantage of this engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a narrow frontal area for low drag. 

The disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio. 

because the crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy. 

If the engine crankshaft is located above the cylinders, it is called an inverted inline engine, which allows the propeller to be mounted up high for ground clearance even with short landing gear. 

An in-line engine may be either air cooled or liquid cooled, but liquid-cooling is more common because it is difficult to get enough air-flow to cool the rear cylinders directly. 

Inline engines were common in early aircraft, including the Wright Flyer, the aircraft that made the first controlled powered flight. 

However, the disadvantages of the design soon became apparent, and the inline design was abandoned, becoming a rarity in modern aviation. 



V-type engines provide more horsepower than in-line engines and still retain a small frontal area.

In V-type engines, the cylinders are arranged in two in-line banks generally set 60Â° apart. 

The vast majority of V engines are water-cooled. 

This type of engine was used mostly during the second World War and its use is mostly limited to older aircraft.

Horizontally opposed engines are often referred to as boxer or flat engines. 

Continued improvements in engine design led to the development of this type of engine, which remains the most popular reciprocating engine used on smaller aircraft. 

These engines always have an even number of cylinders, since a cylinder on one side of the crankcase "opposes" a cylinder on the other side. 

The majority of these engines are air cooled and usually are mounted in a horizontal position when installed on fixed-wing airplanes. 

Opposed-type engines have high power-to-weight ratios because they have a comparatively small, lightweight crankcase. 

In addition, the compact cylinder arrangement reduces the engine's frontal area and allows a streamlined installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag.

Piston engines drive a spinning shaft. 

The propeller is attached to that shaft. 

At least two (but usually three or four) blades make up the propeller.

In most applications of steam power today, the piston engine has been replaced by the more efficient turbine.
