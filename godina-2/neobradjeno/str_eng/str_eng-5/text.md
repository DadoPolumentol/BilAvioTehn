	Here are some of the basic components of aircraft's wings.

	Skin: The outer surface of the wing. Originally made of fabric, modern aircraft use aluminum or composite materials due to their lightweight and rust-resistant properties. 
	
	Spar: The main center beam of the wing, designed to carry the structural loads and transfer them by attachment to the fuselage, or body, of the aircraft.
	
	Fuel Tank: Commonly located in the wing, fuel can either be housed in its own tank or allowed to fill the cavities between the ribs. In addition to powering the engines. the fuel adds rigidity to the wing.
	
	Flaps: Are a "high lift/high drag" device. Not only do they improve the lifting ability of the wing at slower speeds by changing the camber, or curvature of the wing, they also create more drag, meaning an aircraft can descend, or lose altitude faster, without gaining airspeed in the process. 
	
	Root: The wing root is the portion of the wing that attaches to the fuselage, or body of the aircraft. 
	
	Wing Tip: It is furthest from the fuselage and is typically where the navigation lights are	mounted (a red light on the left. a green light on the right).
	
	Slats: Another "high lift" device typically found on swept or delta wing aircraft. They are similar to the flaps except they are mounted on the leading edge of the wing. They also assist in changing the camber to improve lifting ability at slower speeds.
	
	Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the wing's length to its chord line. A wing with a high aspect ratio will perform well at slow speeds and produce large quantities of lift, but at the expense of maneuverability and airspeed. A wing with a low aspect ratio on the other hand will have a sleek appearance and allow an aircraft to fly faster, or be more 
	maneuverable.
	
	Camber: The name given to the curvature of the upper or lower surfaces of the wing. A higher camber, or more curved surface, results in an aircraft that can fly at slower speeds while still generating sufficient lift for flight.
	
	Chord Line: The theoretical line running from the leading edge of the wing to the trailing edge.
	
	Leading Edge :The front edge of an aircraft's wing.
	
	Trailing Edge :The rear edge of an aircraft's wing.
	
	skin is the material which covers the structure of an aircraft
	
	spar is a spanwise structural member of a wing which carries the ribs
	
	wing root is the end of the wing attached to the fuselage
	
	rib is structural member of an airfoil which gives aerodynamic shape and rigidity 
	
	stringer is thin metal strip running the length of a wing which strengthens the skin

	Skin is the outer layer of an aircraft.
	
	Ribs and stringers are cross pieces of the airframe that provide an aircraft wing with shape and strength.
	
	Spar is the main longitudinal beam of an aircraft wing.
	
	Wingtip  is the outermost part of the wing.
	
	Wing root is the part of the wing where it meets with the fuselage.
	
	Stringers are attached to the wing skin, and run span-wise. Their job is to stiffen the skin so that it does not buckle when subjected to compression loads caused by wing bending and twisting, and by loads from the aerodynamic effects of lift and control-surface movement.
	
	Fuel tank is a container inside a vehicle that holds fuel.
	
	Flaps extend outward from the fuselage to the midpoint of each wing. They always move together.
	
	Another name for tail or tail unit/assembly is the empennage
	
	The components of the plane that control its stability are the horizontal and vertical stabilizers.
	
	The part of the plane where the pilots sit is the cockpit or flight deck.
	
	The main lifting surface of an airplane is the wing 
	
	The reason for which the landing gear on some planes is retractable is to reduce drag.
	
	Ailerons extend from about the midpoint of each wing outward to the tip. They move in
	opposite directions.
	
	Low wing configuration is rooted at the bottom part of the aircraft fuselage, usually just below the pilot's seat in GA aircraft. Good for touring and passenger aircraft, low drag, easier to land due to higher ground effect.
	
	For high wing configuration the wings are rooted on top of the fuselage. Better ground visibility, gravity fuel feed, but high drag.
	
	For Parasol wings the wings are mounted above the fuselage on struts.
	
	For Mid wing configuration the rooting takes place approximately half way up the fuselage. Very strong wing and fuselage binding, good for aerobatics.

	Rectangular wing It is sometimes referred to as the "Hershey Bar" wing in reference to the candy bar it resembles, is a good general purpose wing. It can carry a reasonable load and fly at a reasonable speed, but does nothing superbly well. It is ideal for personal aircraft as it is easy to control in the air as well as inexpensive to build and maintain.
	
	Eliptical wing:	It is similar to the rectangular wing and was common on tail-wheel aircraft produced in the 1930s and 40s. It excels however in use on gliders, where its long wingspan can capture the wind currents easily, providing lift without the need for a lot of forward momentum, or airspeed.
	
	Swept wing:	It is the "go to" wing for jet powered aircraft. It needs more forward speed to produce lift than the rectangular wing, but produces much less drag in the process, meaning that the aircraft can fly faster. It also works well at the higher altitudes, which is where most jet aircraft fly.
	
	Delta wing:	It advances the swept wing concept, pulling the wings even further back and creating even less drag. The downside to this however is that the aircraft has to fly extremely fast for this wing to be effective. This is why it's only found on supersonic aircraft (aircraft that fly faster than the speed of sound) such as fighter jets and the Space Shuttle orbiter. There were also two commercial passenger jets that used this wing design, the Russian TU-144 and the Concorde both of which could cruise at supersonic speeds.

	Delta wing – triangular
	
	Variable geometry wing – change angles in flight
	
	Straight wing – long consistent width
	
	Swept-back wing – arrow-shaped
	
	Tapered wing – perpendicular
	
	Flaps extend outward from the fuselage to the midpoint of each wing.
	Ailerons extend from about the midpoint	of each wing outward.
	
	Ailerons are mounted on the trailing edge of each wing near the wingtips, and move in opposite directions. When the pilot moves the stick left, or turns the wheel counter-clockwise, the left one goes up and the right one goes down.
	
	Flaps are normally hinged surfaces mounted on the trailing edges of the wings of a fixed-wing aircraft to reduce the speed and to increase the angle of descent for landing without increasing air speed. They shorten take-off and landing distances as well as improving climb rate.
	
	Leading edge is the front edge of a wing, rotor, tail or other airfoil.
	
	Winglets are a small vertical surface at the tips of the wings. They help direct the turbulent airflow that all wings have at the tips. They make the wings more efficient.

	A tailplane, also known as horizontal stabilizer (or stabiliser). is a small lifting surface located on the tail behind the main lifting surfaces of a fixed-wing aircraft as well as other non-fixed wing aircraft such as helicopters and gyroplanes. It serves three purposes: equilibrium, stability and control.

	elevator is a control surface on the tailplane of an aircraft, for making it climb or descend.
	
	The elevator is a movable airfoil that controls the up-and-down motion, or pitch. of the airplane's nose. Moving the elevators up into the airstream (airflow) will cause the tail to go down and the nose to pitch up. A pilot controls pitch by moving a control column or stick.
	
	Pitch is 
		1. the alternate lift and descent of the nose and tail of an airplane.
		2. to oscillate about a lateral axis so that the nose lifts or descends in relation to the tail.
	
	vertical stabilizer is a structure having a shape that provides lift, propulsion, stability, or directional control in a flying object
	
	antiservo serves to artificially increase stability and also make the controls heavier in feel to the pilot.
	
	to pivot means to cause to rotate, evolve or turn
	
	The vertical tail structure is divided into the vertical stabilizer and the rudder. The front section is called the vertical stabilizer and is used to prevent the aircraft from yawing back and forth. Moving an airplane's nose left or right is known as a yaw motion. The rudder is at the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer and is used by the airplane to help control turns. Rudder motion is usually controlled by two pedals on the floor of the cockpit, which are pushed by the pilot.
	
	The rudder is a vertical control surface attached to the rear of the fin used to steer an aircraft, in conjunction with the ailerons.
	
	Trailing edge is the rear edge of an airfoil.
	
	One type of empennage design does not require an elevator. Instead, it incorporates a one-piece horizontal stabilizer that pivots from a central hinge point. This type of design is called a stabilator. For example, when you pull back on the control wheel, the stabilator pivots so the trailing edge moves up. causes the nose of the airplane to move up. Stabilators have an antiservo tab extending across their trailing edge.
	
Zika6

	The horizontal stabilizer is placed at the back of the fuselage underneath the vertical stabilizer which is perpendicular to it.
	
	Elevators are fixed surfaces on a horizontal stabilizer.
	
Zika7

	A T-tail is an aircraft tail stabilizer configuration in which the horizontal surfaces  are mounted to the top of the vertical stabilizer.

	Traditionally, the horizontal control surfaces are mounted to the fuselage at the base  of the vertical stabilizer. The resulting arrangement looks like the capital letter T when viewed from the front or back. The tail surfaces are mounted well out of the way of the rear fuselage, permitting this site to be used for the aircraft's engines. This is why the T-tail arrangement is also commonly found on airliners with rear-mounted engines, including trijets.
	
	
	Insert these words: fin, rear, movable, elevators, arrangement
	In aircraft, a V-tail (sometimes called a Butterfly tail) is an unconventional arrangement of the tail control surfaces that replaces the traditional fin and horizontal surfaces with two surfaces set in a V-shaped configuration when viewed from the front or rear of the aircraft. The rear of each surface is hinged, and these movable sections combine the tasks of the elevators and rudder.
	
Zika8

	The conventional tail design is the most common form. It has one vertical stabilizer placed at the tapered tail section of the fuselage and one horizontal stabilizer divided into two parts, one on each side of the vertical stabilizer. For many airplanes, the conventional arrangement provides adequate stability and control with the lowest structural weight. About three-quarters of the airplanes in operation today, including the Airbus A300, the Boeing 777 and 747, and the Beech Bonanza A-36, use this arrangement.
	
	A twin tail is a specific type of vertical stabilizer arrangement found on the empennage of some aircraft. Two vertical stabilizers - often smaller than a single conventional tail would be - are mounted at the outside of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer. This conjoined is also known as an H-tail, as it resembles a capital "H" when viewed from rear. A special case of twin tail is twin boom tail arrangement or tail where the aft airframe consists of two separate fuselages, "tail booms", which each have one fin and rudder but share a double one single horizontal stabilizer.
	
	Although the conventional aircraft described above represent 95% of all the world's aircraft some of the most important designs are Tailless. Concorde, the AVRO Arrow, and the Space Shuttle are three notable examples. As you may have noticed they are all Supersonic aircraft. In the future, when supersonic flight becomes more common we will probably see more tailless aircraft. On the tailless aircraft the pitch controls and roll controls must both be on the wing. There can be separate elevators and ailerons or they can be combined into one set of controls known as Elevons. The tailless aircraft still usually has a vertical fin with a rudder.

	4 stroke cycle
	
	1.Intake: Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at TDC dead center, and ends at BDC dead center. In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston. 
	
	2.Compression: This stroke begins at BDC or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at TDC. In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.

	3.Combustion: Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at top	(the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture ignited a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by high compression generated heat (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to bottom. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft. 
	
	4.Exhaust: Also known as outlet. During the exhaust stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.
		
Zika10

	The engine will always complete the cycle in the same order. intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust.
	
	Intake or Induction: The purpose of the intake or induction stroke is to draw a mixture of air and fuel into the cylinder. This stroke takes place with the piston moving down from TDC to BDC.	The inlet valve must be open to allow the air-fuel mixture into the cylinder while the exhaust valve remains closed. The downward motion of the piston causes the pressure in the cylinder to drop, which sucks the mixture into the cavity left behind by the piston's motion.
	
	Compression: The purpose of the compression stroke is to compress the air -fuel mixture that has been sucked into the cylinder head before ignition takes place. This is accomplished by the piston moving upward from BDC towards TDC.	The motion of the piston reduces the volume occupied by the mixture, causing the pressure and temperature to increase inside the cylinder. The inlet and exhaust valves remain closed for the majority of the stroke (the inlet valve remains open approximately 50° past BDC to allow the optimal amount of mixture to enter the cylinder). As the piston approaches TDC, the spark plug fires, igniting the mixture. The spark is timed such that the inertia of the piston travelling upward is not retarded by the ignition but continues to TDC, where the stroke ends.
	
	Power: The rapidly expanding gas ignited by the spark plug causes the pressure inside the cylinder to spike, forcing the piston back down from TDC to BDC. As the piston moves downward the increasing volume causes a reduction in pressure and temperature in the cylinder. It is this power stroke that forces the crankshaft to rotate, which ultimately drives the propeller and produces thrust. The inlet and exhaust valves remain closed for the majority of the power stroke with the exhaust valve opening just before the piston reaches BDC. The timing of the valve opening is set to ensure that the maximum power is produced while at the same time ensuring that the burnt gas is expelled in the mos efficient manner during the exhaust stroke.
	
	Exhaust: The exhaust valve opens just before the power stroke completes and remains open during the piston's movement from BDC to TDC. The piston motion forces the exhaust gasses out through the open exhaust valve, clearing the cylinder before the intake stroke begins. This completes the cycle and the piston will start to move downward again as the induction step repeats.

	A piston engine is an engine that uses one or more pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. It was first developed during the eighteenth century. Today the most common form of piston engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of petrol, diesel or natural gas and used to power motor vehicles.
	Today, internal combustion engines most commonly use a four-stroke cycle. The four strokes refer to intake, compression, combustion (power), and exhaust strokes that occur during two crankshaft rotations per working cycle. The cycle begins at top dead centre (TDC), when the piston is farthest away from the axis of the crankshaft. On the intake or induction stroke of the piston, the piston descends from the top of the cylinder, reducing the pressure inside the cylinder. A mixture of fuel and air is forced (by atmospheric or greater pressure) into the cylinder through the intake (inlet) port. The intake (inlet) valve (or valves) then close(s), and the compression stroke compresses the fuel-air mixture. The air-fuel mixture is then ignited near the end of the compression stroke, usually by a spark plug or by the heat and pressure of compression. The resulting pressure of burning gases pushes the piston through the power stroke. In the exhaust stroke, the piston pushes the products of combustion from the cylinder through an exhaust valve or valves. The linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a crankshaft. A flywheel is often used to ensure smooth rotation. The more cylinders a piston engine has, the more vibration-free (smoothly) it can run.
	As long as the engine is running, it will continue to repeat the four steps in a four-stroke cycle continuously. Each step in the cycle represents a 180° movement of the piston which corresponds to a half-revolution of the crankshaft. Since it takes two crankshaft revolutions to complete one four-stroke cycle, the complete cycle will be completed at half the engine RPM e.g engine running at 3000 RPM will complete 1500 complete cycles in one minute.

	Power plant
	The power plant is simply the propulsion system and consists of the engines. The sole purpose of the engines is to provide thrust for the airplane. There are many different types of aircraft engines including: piston, turboprop, turbojet and turbofan. Some aircraft, notably gliders, do not have an engine. To take off they must have another source of thrust - that is, the tow-plane which pulls them into the air.
	A plane's power system includes an engine, sometimes one or more propellers, and fuel and oil tanks and lines. The two main types of engines on planes today are reciprocating engines (or piston) and jet engines. In piston engine, the burning of fuel inside a chamber starts a chain of events that ultimately turns a propeller. Piston engines are usually found on smaller airplanes. Jet engines are common on large commercial planes and military aircraft. This type of engine burns fuel but propels a plane forward with a jet of exhaust gas that shoots out behind the plane.
