De-Icing and Anti-Icing

    Purpose: Remove or prevent frozen contaminants (ice, snow, slush) to ensure safe operation.
    Methods:
    De-Icing: Removes frozen contaminants.
        Mechanical: Scraping or pushing with tools.
        Heat: Heated air or fluids.
        Chemical: Glycol-based solutions:
            De-Icing Fluids: Diluted glycol; removes ice but doesn’t prevent reformation.
            Anti-Icing Fluids: Undiluted, viscous glycol; prevents ice formation by creating a barrier.
    Timing: Effective for 10–15 minutes; requires reapplication if exceeded.
    In-Flight Systems: Heated air pipes, inflatable boots, and weeping wings.
    Challenges: Residue can rehydrate into gel, freezing and blocking control systems.

Aerodynamic Forces

    Lift: Generated by the wing’s shape; creates upward force to counteract weight.
    Based on Bernoulli’s Principle: Faster airflow above the wing reduces pressure compared to slower airflow below, creating upward force.
    Weight: Downward force due to gravity.
    Thrust: Forward force from engines.
    Drag: Resistance to thrust, caused by air resistance, including parasitic (friction) and induced drag (from lift).

Aircraft Structure

    Fuselage: Main body of the aircraft; types include truss(steel/aluminium welded into triangular shapes), monocoque(stressed skin carries most loads), and semi-monocoque(stressed skin +     bulkheads + stringers) designs, Features cockpit, cabin and firewall.
    Wings: Main lifting surfaces; Design types(straight, swept-back, delta, tapered and variable geometry or swing wing); Key components (spars, ribs, stringers) and control surfaces     (flaps(lift + drag), ailerons(roll)); Wing Attachment(High-, Mid-, Low-wing).
    Empennage / Tail assembly: Stabilizers; control surfaces(rudder, elevators, or stabilator).
    Landing Gear: Conventional / taildragger(2 forward, 1 read), tricycle(two main, one nose), or tandem(2 sets 1 behind the other) designs.

Ice-Related Aircraft Issues

    Core Effects: Ice changes wing shape (reducing lift, increasing drag), adds weight, and disrupts engine performance.

Historical Context

    Wright Brothers:
        Innovations: Three-axis control system and custom-built engines.
