Weight	Force created by the attraction of Earths gravity	
Lift	Main element that keeps an aircraft in flight and can be defined as the force that is created by an aerodynamic shape moving through the air	
Drag	Aerodynamic force that opposes the forward motion of the aircraft through the air mass<br>Parasitic, Induced drag	
Thrust	Provided by engine(s) of the aircraft	
Parasitic drag	-increases with speed<br>-generated by friction of all parts of the aircraft exposed to the wind	
Induces drag	-Produced on generating life and arises because of the difference in pressure between the air flowing below the wing (high pressure) and above the wind (low pressure)	
Keep an aircraft in flight synonym	maintain an aircraft's airborne status	
Straight-and-level flight	Aircraft maintains constant altitude and heading, with no significant change in pitch, roll or yaw	
Function of the engine	Create thrust	
Function of the wing	Generate lift	
Difference between parasitic and induced drag	Parasitic drag increases with speed while induced drag decreases	
Resistance	Resistance is drag - The force opposing the aircraft's movement through the air	
Airfoil	Device which produces lift from airflow	
Leading edge	Rounded fore part of airfoil	
Chord line	Straight line joining the extremeties of leading and trailing edges<br>=mean / median line	
Mean / median line	Line equidistant from the upper and lower surfaces of the wing<br>= chord line	
Camber	Rise of the mean line from the chord	
Wings	parts of an aircraft that generate lift	
Propellers	Rotating blades on an aircraft that generate thrust	
Flaps	Movable parts on the wings of an aircraft used to increase lift and drag	
Propulsion	Force that moves an aircraft forward	
Relative Wind	the flow of air that moves opposite to the direction of the aircraftâ€™s flight	
Wind Tunnel	testing device where air is blown over a model or section of an aircraft to study how air moves around it	
Elevator	Pitch	
Ailerons	Roll	
Rudder	Yaw	
Pitch	The lateral axis, from wing tip to wing tip	
Roll	The longitudinal axis, from nose to tail	
Yaw	The vertical axis, through the center of the aircraft	
Center of Gravity	Effective point whereby all weight is considered to be	
Operation envelope	Defines the performance limits within which an aircraft can safely operate	
Slats	Increase lift at lower speeds	
Spoilers	reduce lift and increase drag
