MAGNETIC COMPASS
Construction:
Float + 2 magnets + graduated card; pivot + jewel cup; filled with mineral spirits/kerosene; diaphragm/bellows for temperature expansion; lubber line; card read “backwards.”
Limits: usable up to ~18° bank; beyond that → errors.
Errors:
• Variation – difference between true/magnetic.
• Deviation – internal aircraft magnetism (corrected by compensator).
• Acceleration/deceleration (ANDS) – Accelerate North, Decelerate South.
• Northerly turning error (UNOS) – Undershoot North, Overshoot South.
Compensator: two screws → E–W and N–S adjustment.

AUTOPILOT — NOTES
Purpose: reduces workload; maintains heading/altitude; modern systems can control full flight.
Early system (Sperry): gyro heading + attitude → hydraulic elevators + rudder → straight & level.
Modern system:
Computer + sensors (speed, altitude, turbulence).
May include auto-throttle.
Integrated with FMS.
Controls flight from after take-off to landing.
Pilot’s use:
Pilot enters route pre-flight; autopilot cannot taxi/take-off; pilot takes off then engages AP; some systems auto-land.
Crew must monitor AP and take over if it disengages (turbulence, malfunction).
Regulations require 2 crew.
Technician notes:
Systems differ by aircraft; must understand certified system.
Even small surface changes (paint/rivets/locks) can disturb airflow → errors.
Both overuse and underuse cause faults → scheduled full-function tests required.

GPS
Uses: navigation, reduced separation (ADS-B), fleet tracking (ACARS), accident location, ADS-B broadcasts.
Installed vs non-installed devices:
External antenna = avionics.
Internal portable devices = T-PEDS → must be OFF during critical phases.

GPS PRINCIPLES
Provides: lat, lon, altitude, time (4D).
Method: triangulation/pseudo-range.
Satellite sends CA code + ephemeris.
Receiver measures signal travel time × speed → distance.
Frequencies: L1, L2 (receiver mainly uses L1).
Satellites needed:
3 → 2 possible positions;
4 → 1 true position.

FLIGHT INSTRUMENT SENSOR SYSTEMS
AHRS: electronic attitude + heading sensors + computer.
Measures: pitch, roll, yaw from attitude reference.
Uses magnetometer/flux valve for heading.
Requires ground initialization.
Errors accumulate → continual corrections; turbulence reduces accuracy.
ADC: static pressure + ram pressure + temperature → computes pressure altitude, IAS, vertical speed, TAS.
ADAHRS: AHRS + ADC in one unit.
PFD inputs: attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed all from sensor suites (AHRS/ADC/ADAHRS).

DEFINITIONS
Lubber line = reference line.
Ephemeris = satellite orbital data.
Triangulation = position from geometry.
Pseudo-range = distance from signal travel time.
cup – jewel
assembly – compensator
error – deviation
marks – graduation
scale – graduated
field – magnetic
line – lubber
directions – cardinal
housing – compass
Klaxon → an electric horn or warning hooter
Baffled → confused; perplexed; puzzled
Jolt → an abrupt rough or violent movement; jerk
To regain → obtain possession of something again after losing it; retrieve; recover
To coax → to persuade; to manoeuvre
To medevac → to transport casualties to hospital in a helicopter or aeroplane
Laceration → a deep cut or tear in skin or flesh
To take in, feed into = ingest / ingested
To merge with, combine with, join with = integrated with
To step in, assume, undertake = take over
To cut loose, disconnect = disengage / disengage itself
