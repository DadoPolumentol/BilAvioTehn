### ‚úàÔ∏è 1. **Pitot-Static Flight Instruments**

* **Purpose:** Measure airspeed, altitude, and rate of climb/descent.
* **Components:** Pitot tube (for dynamic pressure), static ports (for static pressure), connecting lines, and 3 instruments (ASI, VSI, Altimeter).
* **Function:**

  * *Pitot tube* faces the relative wind, measures **dynamic (ram) pressure**.
  * *Static port* measures **ambient pressure**.
  * Difference between the two gives airspeed (ASI).
* **Blockage:** Causes errors in ASI, Altimeter, and VSI. Common causes: dirt, ice, insects.
* **Preflight:** Check pitot cover removed, openings clear.

### üåÄ 2. **Gyroscopic Flight Instruments**

* **Principles:** Rigidity in space, precession.
* **Common instruments:**

  1. Turn coordinator
  2. Heading indicator (Directional gyro)
  3. Attitude indicator (Artificial horizon)
* **Power source:** Electric or vacuum.
* **Modern systems:** Mechanical gyros replaced by **laser gyros / AHRS (Attitude Heading Reference System)**.
* **Function:** Show attitude, rate of turn, and heading.

### üß≠ 3. **Airspeed Indicator (ASI)**

* **Measures:** Dynamic pressure (Pitot) ‚Äì Static pressure.
* **Types:** Analog (needle) or digital (tape on PFD).
* **Color codes:**

  * White arc ‚Äì flap operating range
  * Green arc ‚Äì normal operating range
  * Yellow arc ‚Äì caution range (smooth air only)
  * Red line ‚Äì never exceed speed (V_NE)
* **Modern PFD:** Shows airspeed tape on the left; digital readout; changes color to red when exceeding limit.

### üíª 4. **Avionics**

* **Definition:** Aviation + Electronics = systems for navigation, communication, flight control, and display.
* **Examples:** FMS, autopilot, flight control, comms, radar, GPS, air data systems.
* **Importance:** Modern aircraft can‚Äôt fly safely without avionics.

### üìö 5. **History of Avionics**

| Era       | Development                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1903‚Äì1930 | First use of avionics; simple communication & navigation aids. |
| 1930s     | Direction Finder (DF / Homing beacon).                         |
| WWII      | Radar, IFF (Identification Friend or Foe).                     |
| 1940s‚Äì50s | VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range).               |
| 1960s     | Transistors make systems smaller, lighter.                     |
| 1970s     | Solid-state & digital avionics appear.                         |
| 1980s     | Microprocessors, long-range navigation (Loran-C, Omega).       |
| 1990s     | GPS introduced; Omega retired.                                 |
| 2000s+    | Glass cockpits, EFIS, moving maps, LCD displays.               |

### üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è 6. **Cockpit Evolution**

* **Old (Analog):** 100+ dials and switches, cluttered layout.
* **Modern (Glass cockpit):** LCDs replace gauges; fewer controls; integrated flight, navigation, and systems displays.
* **Advantages:** Less workload, clearer data, faster response.
* **Risk:** If electrical power fails, all displays can go black ‚Üí total loss of info (rare event).

---

### üß© 7. **Analog vs Digital Flight Instruments**

* **Analog:** Mechanical/electromechanical dials; e.g., Pitot pressure expands a diaphragm.
* **Digital:** Use air data computer ‚Üí converts pressure into digital signal ‚Üí sent via **data bus** to displays.
* **EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System):** Consists of

  * PFD (Primary Flight Display)
  * MFD (Multi-Function Display)
  * EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System)
* **Advantages:** Lighter, clearer, lower power use.

### üåç 9. **Attitude Indicator**

* **Displays:** Aircraft‚Äôs pitch and bank relative to horizon.
* **Works on:** Rigidity in space (gyro-based).
* **Electronic version:** Large horizon on PFD, linked to AHRS.
* **Adjustment:** Miniature airplane aligned with horizon bar for pilot‚Äôs view.

### üí¨ 10. **Useful Terms**

* **To sample:** take a small portion for measurement.
* **To mount:** attach something to something else.
* **To face:** have front turned toward something.
* **To defy:** resist or challenge (e.g., gyroscopes ‚Äúdefy gravity‚Äù).
* **Blockage:** obstruction.
* **Moisture:** humidity, water presence.
* **Accuracy:** correctness.
