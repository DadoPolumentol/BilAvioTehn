MICROBIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATION (not corrosion)

It mainly occurs in fuel tanks, on turbine-engined aircraft. 
Fungal growth may occur in temperate climates when water is present in the fuel tank. 
(Unless the fuel has an additive to protect against it) Where fungal growth has formed, there is a high probability that corrosion of the tank will occur.


SURFACE CORROSION

General roughening, etching or pitting of the metal surface, frequently accompanied by a powdery deposit of corrosion products may be caused by direct chemical or electrochemical attack.
Corrosion may spread under the surface coating unnoticed until the paint or plating is lifted off the surface by the corrosion products or forms blisters.


PITTING CORROSION

Corrosive pockets on the surface of the metal. 
Pitting corrosion is a highly localized form of metal deterioration that creates small but deep holes on the surface. 
It usually occurs when protective films break down due to chlorides or other aggressive ions. 
Because pits can penetrate rapidly, this type of corrosion is dangerous and often difficult to detect


DISSIMILAR METAL CORROSION

This may be taking place out of sight and may result in extensive pitting. 
It may or may not be accompanied by surface corrosion. 
It is caused by a potential difference existing between two metals
where plating or jointing compound has been removed or omitted. 
Examples may be found where steel bolts, nuts or studs contact magnesium alloys.


INTERGRANULAR CORROSION

Intergranular corrosion can occur, for example, when a steel rivet is installed in an aluminium structure. 
Electrolyte enters through cracks in the paint and begins to attack the aluminium along its grain boundaries beneath the surface. 
The aluminium acts as the anode and the steel rivet as the cathode, allowing hidden corrosion to spread until significant structural weakening occurs.
This is a direct attack along the grain boundaries of an alloy and results from a lack of uniformity in the alloy structure, 
caused by changes occurring during heating and cooling during manufacture or during heat treatment. 
Intergranular corrosion often exists without visible surface evidence and so the structure may be weakened considerably. 
Intergranular corrosion may often be detected by ultrasonic, eddy current or radiographic inspection techniques.


EXFOLIATION CORROSION

Very severe Intergranular corrosion may cause the surface of the material to exfoliate. 
This is lifting of layers of metal due to de-lamination at the grain boundaries. 
Exfoliation corrosion often attacks 7000 series alloys - with an appreciable amount of Zinc. 
Spars, stringers and other high strength parts which are extruded or hot rolled are often susceptible to this kind of corrosion if they have been poorly heat treated, 
because the grains tend to form in layers. 
Corrosion attacks the grain boundaries, the alloying agents being more reactive than the base metal. 
The corrosive by-products tend to force the metal apart and cause delamination of the material.


STRESS CORROSION

This is a particular form of Intergranular corrosion and results from the combined effect of stresses on the structure. 
In highly stressed parts like landing gear components, cracks may originate from a stress riser such and a scratch or surface corrosion. 
It is characteristic of aluminium, copper, stainless steels and high strength alloy steels. 
It may occur along lines of cold working and signs of stress corrosion are minute cracks radiating from areas of the greatest stress concentration. 
Likely areas for this type of corrosion are landing gear actuators, shock absorbers, bellcranks with pressed in bushes or other areas where parts are a force fit, 
highly stressed or have residual stresses induced during the forming process.


FRETTING CORROSION

This occurs where two mating surfaces are subject to slight relative motion. 
The movement wears away protective coatings and removes minute particles which oxidise to form hard, abrasive compounds which expose further areas of metal to corrosive attack. 
In it's early stages the debris of this corrosion forms black powder,streaks or black deposit. 
The most likely areas are gears, screw jacks, loose panels, splined hydraulic pump drives and rivets (when they become loose). 
It may be serious enough to cause cracking and fatigue failure


CREVICE CORROSION

Severe localised corrosion at narrow openings or gaps between metal components, often due to flexing. 
Corrosive agents are able to penetrate into the joint.
Crevice corrosion occurring inside a narrow gap between metal components. 
Areas with low oxygen concentration become anodic, while regions exposed to higher oxygen concentration become cathodic. 
This oxygen imbalance creates a potential difference that drives corrosion to develop inside the crevice, even though the outer surface may remain unaffected


FILIFORM CORROSION

This is corrosion occurring beneath the paint or protective finish in the form of random threadlike filaments. 
The paint or coating often bulges or blisters. 
Found mostly in clad aluminium (Alclad) where the cladding has been pierced and corrosion has spread under the surface in thread like lines unnoticed until it becomes quite severe
